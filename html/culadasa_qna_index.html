<p>This document contains a transcription of all the questions that were
asked during Culadasa’s Q&amp;A sessions that were held from October
2017 until May 2021.</p>
<p>I have put this together to make the information contained in the
recordings of those sessions more easily accessible and searchable.</p>
<p><span class="text-underline">Some basic notes on how to use this
document</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The heading of each question is a timecode which also links to
the exact place in the video where that question was asked.</p></li>
<li><p>If a notable topic came up during the discussion, I added it to a
list of keywords that I put after each question. This should help with
searching through this document. I also linked some of the keywords to
the part of the video where that topic was discussed.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes I also included quotes from the answer to the question
if something was said that stood out to me as significant and worth
including here as a quote. Each quote also contains a timestamp linking
to the relevant part of the video.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In total there are 61 video recordings, all of which can be found on
<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTnlZBjDOwI-dCH8sOta9BQ/videos">Culadasa’s

<p>How do arising of <i>pīti</i> and spontaneous body movements relate
to purification of the mind? Do you have any advice not mentioned in TMI
for someone who is going through a prolonged period of these sometimes
painful movements (besides therapy, yoga, qigong or taichi)? Will just
sitting with the movements eventually release the blocks or will
sometimes other methods be required? What would you advise someone who
has been going through it for about a year now, and whose development of
concentration has stalled because of the movements around Stage 6–7.</p>

<p>When practicing at Stage 5, breath sensations feel very smooth and
uniform. How can you reconcile this with the instructions to keep breath

<p>It’s often said that Awakening is a recognition or understanding, not
a state that is subject to passing away. Even today, though, some
prominent people and researchers continue to view it as something that
is more state-like, something that one could fall out of, and that
could, in principle be measured in, say, neurological terms. What is

<p>We are two meditators from Spain, and have been practicing daily for
two years. One does one or two sessions, the other three or four of
sitting and walking meditation. We also listened to several hours of
online content. We have made big progress. First of us is stagnant and
having difficulties adding more sessions; the other feels continuous
progress, but with a lot of mind wandering. What makes people
<em>not</em> acheive Stage 10 in one year? How much time does the
majority of meditators take until Stage 4. We regard that stage as
critical.</p>

<p>Completely overcoming the fetters of sense-desire and ill will is a
toil for a layperson in a society which bombards us with sense pleasures
and divides us with adversarial state of politics and the media. Do you

<p>TMI says that long month or year retreats are not critical to
achieving Insight since regular diligent practice 1–2 hours a day is
sufficient for progress. At the same time, Ajahn Chah said that solitude
is essential for a meditator’s progress, especially for novices.
Likewise, <i>Ānāpānasati Sutta</i> begins the explanation about a monk
that goes into the wilderness to be alone.</p>
<p>My line of work as a CEO is generally known to be stressful. I
sometimes worry that it would be hard for me to get beyond the current
Stage 4, unless I find a way to spend a few weeks or months in solitude.
Could you please comment on how important solitude is to the progress in
the early stages.</p>

<p>How can somebody be an adept meditator, and also engage in physically
and sexually abusive behavior? If this practice does in fact incline one
towards compassion for all beings, how can it be that there have been
multiple cases of respected and advanced practitioners who have acted in
this way? My practice has been incredibly valuable to me over the last
few years, but I find that this one issue which sometimes undermines my
faith in the dharma, as it seems to imply that changes are not as
profound as many would suggest.</p>

analytical meditation can be used to cultivate <i>pīti</i>, but little

recommend particular topics for it? I found that analytical meditation
had really helped with my understanding of the dharma, and my

<p>My understanding of the law of karma is that our actions in this life
will generate good/bad karma/conditions that will ripen upon us in
future lives, and that the purpose of karma is to encourage the practice
of virtue. However, since you have taught us that there is no
reincarnation, no <i>atman</i>, no past/present/future separate selves
to inherit good/bad karma, then does a belief in karma provide any
benefit or have any meaningful role in TMI? In other words, is the
belief in karma among the rites and rituals of Buddhism that are to be
eventually discarded?</p>

<p>Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional. Hence, pain and suffering
are two different things. If we remove the suffering, is pain just a
sensation? Like the sensations of my back touching the chair⁠<span
class="em-dash">—</span>a neutral sensation, or the sensations of a
massage⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>a pleasant sensation. There must
be something intrinsic to the sensation that characterizes it as pain,
pleasure, or neutral. If this is true, the suffering that is produced by
the reaction to the pain is the only one that can be removed by not
having aversion to it, and therefore not triggering the suffering. But
the part that belongs to pain is still there, which contradicts the
statement at the beginning. It seems like we are working to remove the
layer of suffering that depends on the logic by which we respond to, but
there’s still another dimension that is unremovable. I am confused about
this especially if we add the idea of realizing Awakening and attining
fourth path, which if properly done, deepening the insight into no-self
seems to remove the assumption of being a self, which is the thing that
is susceptible to the suffering. Does this realization remove the
reactions to the pain and the part of the suffering that goes with them,
but not the part that is intrinsic to the pain?</p>

<p>I find it concerning that there are so many “awakened” people who
seem to behave poorly in different ways. At its worst this bad behavior
might involve gross ethical violations, or it might involve grandiosity,
and potentially abusing the guru yoga relationship. Or it may just
amount to personal blind spots, where that person can no longer see
their own faults, and they are unlikely to accept feedback on that
subject. For example, an <i>ariya</i> might dismiss constructive
criticism from someone they see as a worldling since clearly that person
isn’t operating on the same level as they are. For example, someone
could have a highly unified mind except for one heavily fortified area
of delusion or bad behavior, i.e. a blind spot. They might truly come to
believe that as a realized bodhisattva, the ordinary rules do not apply
to them. I know people who are actually wary of Awakening since they
don’t want to become deluded or grandiose. What is the best way to
prevent that?</p>

<p>I’m working with Stage 6 practices. In general I’ve noticed a change
in perception of the breath at the nose. There is a sense of having
descended into the sensations, whereas previously there was a spatial
sense of distance from the breath. Also, breath sensations associated
with the nose seem to manifest in other body locations despite stable
attentional scope at the nose. I have been interpreting this as a
conceptual stripping away of the breath experience that is described as
a characteristic of the acquired appearance, <i>uggaha-nimitta</i>.</p>

repeatedly once on the path, and that it never seems to end. And he also
spoke of being in the Dark Night for the majority of his life since
Awakening.</p>

focused on the third eye region. I’m now reading Stage 8. You say that
this is an internally generated phenomenon. As a neurologist, it
fascinates me. Could you comment?</p>

<p>I’m wondering, is it possible to progress through the Ten Stages, and

jhānas etc. while walking?</p>

<p>In <i>The Mind Illuminated</i>, in your discussion of body scan, you
discuss a traditional meditation on the elements (in particular the wind
element), and say that Tibetans call the breath-related sensations that
arise from this practice <i>inner winds</i>. I’m sure, you know that
these inner winds are what is called <i>prāṇa</i> in Sanskrit. Could you
share your thoughts on connections between this awareness cultivated
through the use of the body scan at Stage 5, and the cultivation of

<p>I’ve been meditating for 3–4 months. This week I had a remarkable
session. I was in stable attention and awareness of the breath right
from the get-go. Then I felt happy about being able to meditate, and the
great feeling it gives me. Suddenly a strong tingling sensation came
from the back of my neck, and grew over my head and my whole upper body.
With it came a profound and overwhelming feeling of happiness and bliss
about nothing in particular. My breathing got heavy and I shed some
tears of joy. The whole experience lasted for a few minutes. The rest of
the sit was great as well, and there was even a second, less intense
wave of bliss. How can I acheive this again?</p>

<p>What role do perceptual and sensory changes play in the path?</p>
<p>I’ve noticed that dry insight pracitioners on forums that tend to
emphasize techniques like noting, like at <i>Dharma Overground</i>, tend
to emphasize shifts in their perceptional functioning and senses over
reduction of craving and increase in positive emotions and equanimity
like I’ve seen śamatha-vipassanā tend to do. These shifts tend to
emphasize centerlessness, and opening up of visual field and luminosity
amongst other things. The way these things tend to be phrased seemed
confusing and unappealing to me.</p>
<p>I’m not exactly sure what I’m asking, but just pointing out an
observation that I’ve noticed that maybe you could comment on. I.e. do
the senses of the body operate a little differently before first path,
and then shift at each path? Is this a weird quirk that noting could
have on the brain, but isn’t essential to practice?</p>

that the higher stages of Awakening seems so elusive even for people

experimentations as a fire <i>kasiṇa</i> practice. Then in an

chataka practice, which is somewhat similar to what Ingram is talking
about: using a candle flame to generate an inner image to support
concentration practice.</p>

<p>I’m reading <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master_and_His_Emissary"><i>The

href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL21531165W/Divided_Brain_and_the_Search_for_Meaning"><i>The
Divided Brain</i></a> by Iain McGilchrist. It’s very interesting what
you’ve said at the very end of this discussion of attention and “toys
and process” and manipulation of the world, and how the left-hemisphere
this is. And what you’ve said, “Oh, no, I’m not really interested in all
of the other stuff”, which is more of the right-hemisphere interest.</p>
<p>I found this very powerful practice now: choiceless awareness
meditation, I think you call that. And in you book it’s so beautifully
described⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>that delineation of the region,
of the zone of mindfulness when we begin to explore the connection
between the focused attention and peripheral awareness.</p>
<p>Is this unification in the sense that you describe in your book? It’s
so powerful. Will that be part of the exploration in the retreat that
you’ll be doing?</p>

<p>I did this flame meditation. I’ve been doing it very regularly for
years. It’s so beautiful what you’ve just described because as I looked
and looked and looked, the images would split so that the right and left
visual fields, the right and left eyes were giving me the two images
etc. But as I looked more, and as I let go and let go and let go,
suddenly there was a very clear center, and almost a Buddha-like
luminescence, and then a surrounding⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>kind
of like the peripheral awareness, again, exactly, in many ways what we
were just talking about, this connection.</p>
<p>It was a very beautiful and powerful special experience, but I did
not close my eyes.</p>

advantage?</p>

<p>Is it allowed to apply techniques of a higher stage in order to
achieve the goals of a lower one?</p>
<p>I was able to experience uniform <i>pīti</i> when I was working on
Stage 4. Very quickly I realized that by applying my attention to these
subtle sensations, I get rid of all perceived distractions and dullness.
My sessions are joyful and my daily life is more mindful. Basically, it
was very similar to experiencing the whole body with the breath. I was
surely heading towards Stage 5, but then I asked a question on Reddit to
get validation from more serious practitioners and was strongly
discouraged from doing this technique on Stage 4. So I stopped, and then
was slowed down in my progress and lost a couple of extra months. I am
sure I had to trust my intuition, and to keep working with subtle
sensations as my meditation object to overcome gross distractions,
keeping in mind that I would need to return to the sensations in my
nostrils later on. Now I’m doing Stage 5 practices again, and I see that
working with the whole body allows me to overcome subtle dullness and
getting more mental power better than by doing the body scan.</p>
<p>Would it be advisable to use the whole-body breath to overcome subtle
dullness, and only then spend some time doing body scan in order to
learn to define the scope of attention at will?</p>

<p>How do right effort and equanimity fit together?</p>
<p>Equanimity is total surrender to what is, or as you often formulate
it, “Let it come, let it be, let it go”. This is a process of releasing,
and seems conducive to fourth path’s goal of total uprooting of
<i>taṇhā</i>. Right effort, on the other hand, is to eliminate and
maintain the elimination of unwholesome mental states, and then to
cultivate and maintain positive mental states. This is an active process
of changing the way things are. This practice feels antithetical to the
uprooting of <i>taṇhā</i> because it’s so easy to be averse to
negativity, and attach to the positivity when actively transforming
these mental states.</p>

<p>I’m currently around Stage 5. Sometimes I drive my car for a couple
of hours, and I tried to make this time support my practice.</p>
<p>My understaning is that one can turn many daily activities into
meditation if you can define a scope of attention on the main tasks of
the given activity so that you can observe those tasks, keep your
attention their, like with sensations of breathing at the nose. I tried
to do that in my car by observing surroundings of the car, road and cars
around me, plus movements of the steering wheel and pedals. I can
perform driving mostly automatic on the highway, and this seems safe,
but also helping to train my mind similarly to when I observe my
breath.</p>

repress thoughts a lot.</p>
<p>Basically, when I sit down to meditate, when I first started, I
didn’t hear any thoughts. And working with Tucker, I’m getting a lot
better now. Now my practice is mostly like, putting everything in
awareness. So there’s very little attention, and I try to focus it on
the breath. Those are Tucker’s instructions for me now.</p>
<p>I was wondering if you have anything else to add.</p>

<p>I’m having difficulties with dullness around Stages 3–4. As I go
through the four-step transition to the meditation object, my mind has a
normal amount of clarity, and I can often evoke some joy. But further
into the meditation, my mental energy drops.</p>
<p>I can hardly perceive any breath sensation with clarity even as I try
to focus, and have poor introspective awareness. This feels like a
struggle, and it often frustrates me because I seem to be unable to
easily shake if off with the antidotes.</p>
<p>After applying the antidote, my mental energy goes up just for a few
seconds, and then I gradually settle back to the same low level of
alertness again. Then I become reluctant to apply more antidotes because
I get physically tired of forcefully exhaling, or clenching my muscles,
and perhaps disappoined that it didn’t work, too.</p>
<p>If I stand up to meditate, the frustration carries over, and I can
become annnoyed at how uncomfortable it is, or think that I can’t always
stand up to deal with dullness. I need to learn to deal with it while
sitting.</p>
<p>Sometimes I even stop meditating all together because of this, and
usually with only a few minutes left until the end of the session.</p>
<p>I know that pretty much everything is wrong with the way my mind
currently reacts to dullness, but I still find myself stuck with this
problem. So any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>I’m wondering about doing longer and longer sits, and how to schedule
my sits. If I’m free for six hours in a row, is it good to try and
increase the time of the sits when possible?</p>
<p>Similar to muscle trining, I sit for 90 minutes. Sometimes it can
make me very calm for a while, but sometimes also make me feel
crazy.</p>
<p>I might be able to sit with bearable pain for 30 minutes, but I start
to really want to get rid of that unpleasant pain.</p>
<p>I’m at Stage 4, encountering gross distraction, but no strong
dullness.</p>
<p>The alternative would be to sit for one hour, do walking for 45
minutes, then sit again. This way, I feel it goes easier.</p>
<p>If longer sits are good, would it also be good to sometimes do really
long, rigid, three-part step-by-step walking meditations for as long as
possible? I’ve seen the interview with you and Stephanie Nash discussing
longer sits, which peaked my interest. I’m grateful for your great

<p><i>Śamatha</i> is my go-to practice; it’s been of enormous benefit to
me. That being said, I’ve been dealing with some depression over the
past couple of months, and it’s been characterized by obsessive and
recurring thoughts. These rapid invasive thoughts as well as blunting of
joy are preventing unification of mind, and don’t leave any room for
much stability at all. Even if I’m on the path of <i>śamatha</i>, would
it be wise at a time such as this to diverge completely from the
standard TMI <i>śamatha</i> practice, and instead focus on positive, as
Shinzen would say? Such as doing <i>metta</i>, or qigong exclusively
until the depression has lifted? As it is, my <i>śamatha</i> sits are
enjoyable, but they don’t feel very productive.</p>

<p>My close friend with no meditation experience has deep
depersonalization/derealization symptoms. He currently undergoes
cognitive behavioral therapy. I’m aware that such problems might also
occur as a side effect of meditation, a.k.a. <i>Dark Night</i>. Would it
be wise for hime to practice some forms of meditation that are
recommended as antidotes for <i>Dark Night</i>, e.g. <i>metta</i>, or
would it be irresponsible to give him any meditation-related advice as
he is already under specialist care? Obviously, I do not want to make
him worse, but based on the description of his symptoms, I suspect he
might be in a way closer than me to realizing insights like No-Self or
Emptiness. So, not pursuing this direction could also be a waste of a
great oportunity for Awakening.</p>

<p>You said that not only <i>metta</i>, but also standard TMI meditation
should not be harmful in this situation. For example, getting to Stage
4, which is not very advanced (and is my own current level at the
moment). I haven’t experienced purifications myself yet, but I think I
might experience them soon. Do you think experiencing purifications
would not be harmful to a person experiencing those problems? That
person was actually the one who approached me about meditation, but I
was very cautious about encouraging him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stage 4 can bring things up. And the thing is that meditation is an
adequate tool to deal with those things so long as the person can remain
mindful.</p>
<p>By that I mean they don’t forget who they are now, where they are
now. You know, here I am, sitting in a comfortable room, safe, on a
meditation cushion, and these things are arising in my mind. In a state
of mindfulness, one can deal with a lot of things. But if one is
<em>overwhelmed</em> by memories and emotions, and things like that when
something comes up, then meditation is not the suitable venue for
dealing with those things. […]</p>
<p>Any time that something comes up, and [you] feel overwhelmed by it,
[you] should back away. [You] can reapproach it later on, but if [you]
find that every time it comes up, [you] are overwhelmed by it, then
[you] should be dealing with it with the assistance of a highly trained
therapist.</p>

<p>I love TMI. It’s practice based. But there’s the other aspect. It’s
learning, reading the <i>dharma</i>: virtue, <i>śīla</i> etc.</p>
<p>There’s so many different traditions out there, and what I love about
what you do is that you unify things and bring them together, but still
as a solitary practitioner you have to learn how to discern this stuff
on your own. I’m really struggling with what to take, what to let go of
etc.</p>
<p>Can you provide further explanation/clarification that would help me
to understand, reconcile the apparent contrary views asserted by
teachers like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E1%B9%ACh%C4%81nissaro_Bhikkhu">Ṭhānissaro
Bhikkhu</a> who strongly asserts that the fear induced by belief in
multi-life rebirth is necessary for an effective practice of right view,
virtue etc., and that only when you appreciate the potential for even
the most natural or innocuous-seeming attachment to lead to long-term
suffering, will you be willing to take it seriously and work to abandon
it, and only then will you be really following the path.</p>
<p>I find myself unable to reconcile/accept belief in multi-life rebirth
due to the fledgling insights of <i>anattā</i> that I have already
exprienced. Yet Ṭhānissaro’s view causes me to doubt whether my
well-intentioned practice of renunication is truly adequate.</p>
<p>Can a dedicated practitioner safely reconcile Ṭhānissaro’s orthodox
view of rebirth as an example of skillful means?</p>

Stage 4 practitioner?</p>
<p>I still feel unsure about how to know whether I’m having a
purification or not. Until recently I haven’t experienced anything that
seems to qualify as a purification, but recently during a sit I
experienced extreme unusual tension that came from nowhere, and had no
cause or reason that I could identify. It built up to an almost
unbearable level, then ended, but I did not experience any sensation of
relief or release.</p>

<p>I have attention deficit disorder, and this predisposition seems to
affect my ability to maintain mindfulness throughout daily life, to
allow enough time to practice, and my rate of progress and ability to
maintain stable attention.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have ADD, then you probably aren’t going to be nearly as
successful at stabilizing your attention as most people would be, and as
we describe in the book. But that’s all right. What you do is you shift
the emphasis to the cultivation of strong mindfulness, of strong
awareness. […]</p>
<p>It is [awareness] that is most important in terms of bringing about
Insight and Awakening.</p>
<p>So what you want to do is to keep that in mind. Let that background
awareness be there. [And] what you’ll notice is that the different
things arising and passing away in extrospective awareness and
introspective awareness, they are what is drawing your attention
away.</p>
<p>So it’s just allowing yourself to notice that, not focusing your
attention on it. Just notice that your attention is moving, but that you
<em>know</em> what your attention is moving.</p>

<p>If I’m understanding intention correctly, isn’t there an implication

Are there any resources that might be helpful in better understanding
this?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We talk in TMI about recognizing that you are not doing this, that
it’s all through intention. You form and hold intentions. And intentions
lead to actions. And intentions and actions repeated long enough become
habits, they become automatic.</p>
<p>So we speak of this as though, you know, it’s just a means, a device,
a part of the meditation process, a way to make your meditation work
better, and to give you a more healthy relationship to the meditation
process⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>rather than striving, and selfing,
and “I’ve gotta do this”, things like that.</p>
<p>We present is this way, but at its heart, it is the deepest part of
the <i>dharma</i>. Through developing the mindfulness to recognize and
to direct the intentions, the Mind-System liberates itself.</p>

<p>You have mentioned that there are different ways that stream entry

You’ve also mentioned the value of repeating fruitions. For a person who
has entered the stream gradually, or through a PCE, what approaches,
activities etc. would make further fruitions more likely?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For somebody for whom it happened gradually, […] what you’re doing is
becoming fully conscious of the difference, the distinction between the
way you perceived yourself, and the world, and your relationship to it
[and how you saw things before].</p>
<p>Because all of these Insights mature and deepen throughout the four
paths that were described by the Buddha (and the fourth path <em>is</em>
a path), and it continues throughout this process. Your initial
understanding of these Insights continues to deepen, it continues to
mature, it continues to open up new dimensions.</p>
<p>And there is a process of bringing more and more of your Mind-System
at every level into, first of all, a state of perceiving things through
Insight rather than through our consensual shared reality that we have,
and then, as that spreads, then the deepening, the maturing, the
multidimensional aspect of those very same Insights, that also starts in
certain parts of the Mind-System and needs to spread to others.</p>
<p>And so, holding in consciousness⁠<span
class="em-dash">—</span>rememeber, consciousness is how all of these
parts of the Mind-System are ultimately communicating with each
other⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>so holding clearly in your mind the
understanding that is the gift of Insight, and its distinction from, and
its differences from the delusion that you lived in before will serve
the same purpose as the fruition experience.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I would put more weight on this practice of
intentionally and consciously holding the state of Insight in a very
powerful form as being the most important thing to do.</p>

<p>In TMI you mentioned that Insight into No-Self was what brings people
to achieve first path. You’ve also mentioned elsewhere that there are
different gateways from first path to second path, and that that affects
the progression of how one achieves third path and beyond.</p>
<p>I was wondering if you could talk about different progressions that
could happen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Depending on which is the experiential gateway, and which is the
Insight that triggers the deepening of, really all of the Insights, that
leads to this empowerment, that will have a certain effect on the way
the person experiences the work of second path: whether it’s the focus
on craving gives rise to <i>dukkha</i>, or whether it’s the focus on
craving is an indicator of self-clinging.</p>

progression to the second path is almost natural, but to go beyond that
is a lot more difficult.</p>

interconnectedness, resulting in a few-week long No-Self experience, and
brought on by experiencing the introspective links of dependent
origination, but not while meditating, would you recommend doing any
specific practices to attempt to recreate the insight experience? Would
this advice change depending on their current TMI stage?</p>

<p>Can you please elaborate on the material in Stages 4 and 5, and the
moments of consciouness model regarding the best approach to setting
conscious intention to generate perceiving moments of attention and
awareness?</p>
<p>At Stage 5, I see multiple conscious intentions: intention to observe
the meditation object, intention to maintain continuous extro- and
introspective awareness, intention to detect subtle dullness, intention
to intensify vividness of attention; but when sitting in the Stage 4–5
zone after completing the Stage 4 transition, and while at breath at the
nose, I’m not sure how to handle these multiple intentions best, and
what an optimal approach <em>feels</em> like.</p>
<p>Do I consciously set each separate intention one after the other, or
is it better to somehow fuse multiple intentions into a single, holistic
meta-intention which is asserted continuously?</p>
<h4 id="section-133"><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhtU5ei6YaM&amp;t=30m26s">00:30:26</a></h4>
<p>Follow-Up: When I was reading Stage 5, I became really interested in
generating more perceiving mind-moments with the conscious intention
being a means to acheive that. Now I feel like I’m juggling all these
different intentions. Is it wrong to feel like there should be a
<em>feeling</em> of this intention-setting?</p>
<p>I know it’s a mental activity; it almost feels like attention,
actually. But as I was reading it, it almost felt like there’s a feeling
to it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The feeling to intention, that’s how intention is manifesting
continuously in awareness.</p>
<p>[Someone else mentioned] doing things like repeating the word
“vividness” […] to act as a trigger to help them zero-in, focus-in,
maintain that attention, and not get into dullness.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with doing things like that, but what you’re
doing when you do that is you’re actually taking attention away from the
breath to shift it to the <em>concept</em> of intention and the word
“vividness”. So that’s fine as an initial kind of approach, but you want
to let that go […].</p>
<p>Instead, the intention begins to just be the framing of your mind.
It’s sort of the background state of your mind that [has a continuous
sense of] “I know where I’m heading”.</p>
<p>And where the emphasis is, you just go with the feeling.</p>

<p>I was wondering if you could talk more about the significance of the
<i>kriyās</i> and the best way to work with them.</p>
<p>Since the Mahasi retreat I did in May last year, most of my sits have
included some form of involuntary arm movements, some vigorous arm and
hand flapping, and sometimes it’s smoother yoga-like postures, often it
is accompanied by tension in the middle of the head. I attended another
retreat last week, and the energy disappeared on the third day, but the
day after, the movements were back again.</p>
<p>Prior to the retreat, I had also sometimes started getting odd facial
contortions. It’s nothing unmanageable, although it’s not particularly
enjoyable either.</p>
<p>I’d just like to know the best way to work with the energy as it has
been quite some time since it originally began.</p>

<p>My friend is having problems with the practice. He has social
anxiety, which makes working on the Eightfold Path either impossible, or
extremely difficult. The intensity of the hindrances and ego is such
that his attempts to progress throught the Stages have been cyclic for
more than two years. Falling off the practice, falling asleep while
trying to meditate. We wonder whether a retreat would change critical
conditioning that would allow him to sustain a regular practice. We’ve
heard that retreats do put you on the higher stages, but people fall
back again to the start when they leave the retreat.</p>

<p>My understanding of intention as applied in Stage 2 is as follows:
one sub-mind aware that there is a meditation project in progress,
acting through consciousness, voluntarily directs attention to the
sensations of the breath at the nose. One unconscious sub-mind announces
to consciousness a determination to act, as in “follow and sustain
attention on the breath sensations at the nose” (Stage 2 practice guide,
p. 29). This is setting an intention.</p>
<p>A number of subconsciousness minds that are tuned into consciousness
at the time, hear the recommendation and join in to support the effort
of “following and sustaining attention on the breath sensations at the
nose”.</p>
<p>When one of the team of sub-minds notices that attention has left the
breath, it alerts consciousness, which redirecting sub-mind here as in
then involuntarily redirects attention to the breath.</p>
<p>As this happens over and over, more and more sub-minds get onboard,
and the redirecting becomes a mental habit.</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How accurate is this description of how intention operates?</li>
<li>Even though directing attention to the breath sensations is a
voluntary action, should we also set a conscious intention to do so
allowing it to become more automatic as we progress?</li>

<p>Can you please discuss how a practitioner can better understand the
line between the skillfulness or diligence on the one hand, and
hindrance of striving/over-efforting on the other?</p>
<p>I recently realized that I have been exerting way too much energy
into seeking an intellectual/analytical understanding of the concepts in
TMI and <i>dharma</i>, and I find myself taking a much more relaxed
approach. Or perhaps too relaxed?</p>
<p>For example, I find myself preferring to stay in step 2 of the
four-step transition seeking to become more grounded and aware of body
sensations with less motivation to engage in the highly
energetic/focused following and connecting to the breath that I was
doing previously.</p>
<p>I now feel much more calm and grounded during my sits, which counters
the anxiety that I have been experiencing on the regular basis, but I
wonder if I’m not exerting enough diligence as I’m spending more time
wandering and in distractions.</p>
<p>Per your guidance last month, I’m endeavoring to become more skillful
in the use of intention, but I’m still a bit hazy as how to maintain an
appropriate balance of intention and diligence, while avoiding
striving.</p>

<p>I experiece <i>pīti</i>-like waves of sensations when off the
cushion, while standing, sitting or lying, as well as other prominents
sensations off the cushion, and I wonder what the best way to approach
these experiences is. Is it best to recollect what may have preceded
their onset to reproduce them, to use them as a reminder to practice
awareness of the breath at the nostrils, to ignore them, or some other
method of utilizing them? Also, what do you see as the differences
between the body-scan techniques, and associated intentions that you
teach, and those taught by <a

<p>In TMI, you advocate a combination of concentration and Insight
practice, whereas in MCTB, Daniel advocates separating the two
practices. However, in Stage 7, you give two separate practices: close
following and cultivating the pleasure <i>jhānas</i>. Clearly, they both
require some level of concentration and Insight. The close following
seems to be more of an Insight practice since it involves investigation
of the sensations, breaking them apart to see impermanence, whereas
<i>jhāna</i> is more of a concentration practice in which one is
absorbed in the breath as one object, which can’t be investigated/broken
apart without breaking the absorption. In Stage 7 and onwards, how
should one decide how much investigation to apply?</p>

<p>I’m at a stage where most days after a few minutes, halfway through
the four-step transition I got lots of meditative joy and tranquility
going, which to me sounds like Stage 8. The body is feeling really nice,
awarereness seems expanded, and I sense thoughts and feelings as
vibrations most of the time. It feels natural to do the witness or
meditation on the mind. If I do this though, I will subtle gross
distractions after some time. When I try to do Stage 4 then, I don’t
really feel sensations at the nose. Everything feels so expansive that
it feels kind of forced to make these solid sensations.</p>

<p>Until 16th century, chairs were luxury items, and 2500 years ago,
they would have been rare. Perhaps the Buddha didn’t have a chair, and
that’s the only reason he meditated while sitting on the floor. Is there
a significant advantage that the cushion has over the chair other than
portability? I’ve seen it argued that the lotus position is best for
keeping the spine straight, and therefore preventing dullness. If I

<blockquote>
<p>As one discovers in the progression through Insight, there’s a
realization at some point that in the knowing there’s only the knowing.
The knowing <em>happens</em>. Just happens. It’s independent of any
knower, or even of any known. That neither of those is anything more
than a projection of the mind onto the fact of knowing in order to make
it into the kind of information that we can use and do things with.
[…]</p>
<p>[I]n deep states of meditation, there is a direct experince of that.
The realization that there’s only the knowing, there’s only this
primordial awareness, or this clear light of mind, this <i>rigpa</i>.
And that it’s not just a phenomenon of the individual mind that comes to
this realization, but that it is universal.</p>

from TMI for about two years, with the daily practice for about one hour
during the last year. Right now most of the time is in Stage 5, some in
Stage 6. Last March I’ve completed Goenka’s ten-day silent retreat,
right now starting to plan the next one, and I would really like to join
a retreat by some teachers because of <i>vipassanā</i> organization,
determination of teaching completely dry insight without a lot of
detailed guidance. Can you recommend any particular retreats by teachers
you trust or give general advice on how to find monasteries or other
places where I could possibly go on a reasonable budget, or maybe online
resources with advice for finding retreats. I live in Russia, so I’m
mostly able to travel to Europe or Asia, and hoping to find a place

<p>My current practice is pretty consistently Stage 5. Still working
with subtle dullness at times, although sometimes I’m working at Stage 6
on occasions when I’m feelng pretty alert. I’ve had a few experiences
that I would describe as a brief period of absorption, pacification of
the mind along with feeling like I was metitating sideways, which isn’t
always pleasant and sometimes causes very mild nausea during meditation.
Since then, which was only a few days ago, I’ve notice a moderately
strong tingling sensation on my arms, legs, parts of my face and head
along with periods of very strong flushing in the arms that resembles a
deep sunburn. These sensations happen even when I’m off the cushion, and
I can feel these tingly sensations as I type this.</p>
<p>I’m trying not to make a huge deal out of these sensations, although
they do sort of seem to ground me in the present moment when I focus on
them, and they make body scanning seem almost effortless. I’m wondering
if this is a grade of <i>pīti</i>, which grade it sounds like, and if
it’s normal in meditative practice to have this type of <i>pīti</i> so
early on.</p>

<p>I currently practice at Stages 4–6, sometimes 7, and often encounter
strong dullness and fatigue in m sits resulting from the demands of work
and parenting. Thanks to TMI’s instruction I can quickly diagnose
dullness, and sometimes bring my energy level back up. However, often
the dullness/drowsiness is too strong, in which case I try to work with
it by observing the mind’s activities, including hypnagogic images, and
thoughts, and the aversion to a dull mind. In TMI you say that
continuing to practice with a dull mind still aids unification of mind,
but I wonder whether there’s a point of diminishing returns. and how to
diagnose it when that’s the case.</p>

<p>I am currently at Stage 4. After four-step transition to observing
sensations at the nose, and doing that for five minutes, it seemed like
I switched to a different way of perceiving them. Pulsating and
vibrating. It also feels voluntary, i.e. I can switch back to normal
perception, but then the sensations are very weak. Reading descriptions
from TMI, I’m not sure whether this is acquired perception of the
breath, or perception effects resulting from close following as
described in later stages, or maybe something else, and I should return
to normal perception, and make it stronger with body scanning for a
while.</p>

<p>In your last Q&amp;A session, you made an illuminating account of
<i>rigpa</i> from Dzogchen. I would like to pose three follow-up
questions.</p>
<p>In you Q&amp;A session and the TMI book, you explain consciousness
through the notion of information exchange. In the conventional
dualistic framework there are two aspects to information. On the one
hand, information can be interpreted syntactically, i.e. as a structural
complexity of an object, and even measured as such. In computer science
it is measured in bits, and in physics, in units of negative entropy. On
the other hand, information ultimately requires a subject⁠<span
class="em-dash">—</span>someone who makes semantic sense of the
information. Otherwise, information is synonymous with structural
complexity.</p>
<p>Please correct me if I’m wrong. What is your non-dual interpretation
of information?</p>

<p>Follow-Up: In artificial intelligence, they claim that they might
create a conscious entity. Do you think if there’s a model of the human
brain in terms of information exchange, will it have the consciounsess,
subjectivity or will it be a model that just mimics a conscious
entity?</p>

In addition, I suppose, some form of universal awareness, which in its
rudimetary form is non-personal has to be presupposed. Panpsychism.</p>

absolutely every level. But that doesn’t mean subjectivity is happening

<p>From Stage 6, according to the Mind-System model, metacognitive
awareness results from the activities of the narrating mind.</p>
<p>The narrating mind takes in, combines and integrates information
projected into consciousness by other sub-minds, then projects that back
as a binding moment of consciousness.</p>
<p>In most meditational conversations, the narrating mind is treated
like the big bad wolf⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>something to avoid
or eliminate, but from reading the above, it seems to be important part
of the story.</p>

<p>I’m currently in Stage 0 despite attempting to transition to Stage 1
for years. I aimed to a one-hour sit. Not once have I lasted that long,
and in fact I haven’t atempted to sit for weeks. To be fair, I just came
out of a long depression, and my self-discipline and motivation are
recovering back from extremely low levels. I intellectually understand
that meditation is crazy good for you, yet I haven’t been able to

<p>I understand that the path to Awakening is rewiring the brain to
perceive reality in a manner that is a better approximation of the truth
rather than what evolution deemed important for the propagation of
genes. I’ve heard that the most successfully enlightened people are able
to selectively tune into these viewpoints when they are useful, and then
drop back into their standard experience of Self when it’s appropriate.
I’m wondering if there’s a risk of going too deep to the point where one
is not able to live a normal life in society because they are physically
unable to return to the state of separate Self. For instance, there is a
condition called mirror touch synesthesia which causes individuals to
experience a similar sensation in the same part of the body, such as
touch that another person feels, which could imply that they have a
permanent impairment of their sense of Self.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[I]t’s not like you’re going into some other place and coming out of
it. It’s just that when it’s appropriate, this way of seeing things
arises. And when this way of seeing things arises, it allows you to
participate in that wholeness, which is where your awareness resides.
And as a matter of fact, it’s not even your awareness, it’s just a local
manifestation of the awareness of that wholeness itself, of suchness
itself. So it’s something that suchness does that manifests locally,
that allows local activity.</p>

<p>My carreer has caused me a good deal of suffering. Not becaused it’s
misaligned with Buddhist values, but because it’s not fully aligned with
my values or aptitudes. Meditation has eased the suffering over the past
few years, but I still feel a deep longing for something more creative
and meaningful to me. In this way, hopefully, I can maximize benefit to
others as well. My question is: related to career, or other big facets
of life, how do we disentangle simple aversion from following the

<p>Duplicate: Intellectually, I’m struggling to reconcile having worldly
goals in my life with the mission of Awakening. It seems like having
career goals, and romantic attachments, sexual desires, the worldly
life⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>these are ultimately delusions based
on craving and narratives about the Self. Wouldn’t the eradication of
craving ultimately mean abandoning these things as superficial, and the
subsequent adoption of a monastic-like lifestyle.</p>
<p>Would an awakened being even have a calling in life? A writer, an
artist, a scientist, a CEO?</p>
<p>Isn’t the motivation behind these creative activities ultimately
craving?</p>
<p>Would an arhat have sex? Would they want to if desire was truly
gone?</p>
<p>Aren’t worldly goals just delusions based on craving?</p>
<p>How do you reconcile living a modern Western lifestyle with fetishes,
achievement, career, sex, fame, finding a romantic partner as the ideal
forms of happiness with the dharma, which sees through these things?</p>
<p>Modern life seems designed to provoke craving in us. I practice
around Stage 9, and I consider myself to be very happy, but the
pressures of the world like finding a job, providing for the future chip
away at my happiness. I say this, but I also feel like sometimes the
dharma, or at least the cult of renunciation can be life-denying.</p>
<p>But then I wonder if that’s just me rationalizing not wanting to give
up things like sex for being an artist, or achieving something with my
life.</p>
<p>These worldly things are fun, but they also come with stress, but at
the same time, I don’t want to, in this stage of my life, live like a
monk. Even though I know it’s all ultimately ridiculous.</p>
<p>There is a conflict here, I feel, between Western values and dharma,
which tells you to give up worldly things. Western Buddhism seems to say
you can have your cake and eat it too while using techniques that were
originally designed for monastics retreating from the world.</p>

<p>I have a question about the subjective value of Enlightenment. In a
blog post, Shinzen Young says, “If I was given the choice of living one
more day expreriencing life the way I experience it, or living 20 more
years as a wealthy, healthy celebrity/sexual athlete beloved by
everyone, but not experiencing what I experience, vis-à-vis,
Enlightenment, the decision would be a no-brainer: I’ll take the one day
of enlightened living.” Would you agree with this, and more generally,
is there any amount of material success that would subjectively seem
better, than even one hour of enlightened living? Such comparisions seem
enormously helpful for me to generate motivation to meditate.</p>

<p>I sent a question a few months ago about my heart rate suddenly
increasing to such an extent that it felt like dying after a kind of
insight experience. This happened again, but in a deeper way than
before. I’m writing this question as I’m having my monthly two-day
retreat. I am at Stage 7.</p>
<p>The meditation sessions started very sharp, and soon after I entered
a <i>jhāna</i>. Around 30–40 minutes later, suddenly I felt as though my
senses were dissolving, but it happened consciously as I suddenly felth
this happening. Everything didn’t dissolve all at once, but it was more
of a slow dissolving that seemed like rapid movement. Existence seemed
rapid, very quickly my senses disappeared; even my sense of being in the
body vanished. As this happened a strange sensation of spinning around
very fast became the one thing I felt. As if I was sitting on a wheel
that someone was turning very fast. But the strangest thing was that I
had no feeling as if my body was spinning. Just as if I were spinning
without the body.</p>
<p>Not long after this happened, maybe a minute or so, or even less
after the experience started, again my heart felt as if it was beating
out of my chest, and I was about to die if I gave in. I wanted to give
in fully, but somewhere it was still blocking me from doing so. The
strangest thing was that I felt sort of at peace, just my heart was
going like crazy, but it didn’t feel as if I was panicking. The only
non-happy feeling I felt was not fully giving in to it, if that makes
sense. This entire experience lasted, I think, 10–13 minutes or so.</p>
<p>I’m writing this the day after the experience. Somehow my mind woke
me up after 3 hours of sleep with heart palpitations that have been
active, but decreasing during the day.</p>
<p>For several days now, I’ve been having heart palpitations that
sometimes make it impossible to sleep. I also felt nauseous, and even
noticed my stool has turned yellow. A sign of stress or anxiety.</p>
<p>My question is: is this normal, and is this a result of an Insight
not being fully accepted by some sub-minds, perhaps? Also, have you seen
this kind of experience with any of your other students?</p>

<p>I’ve been meditating for almost 4 years now, and for the last year
and a half, I have a terrible problem with tension and the resulting
pain in the muscles of my face. As my stability of attention improves,
the tension increases. Even doing walking meditation, when my attention
on the feet gets more exclusive, my face will tighten up. My skill level
has decreased significantly over hundreds of hours of daily one and a
half hour sits. I can only seem to keep the tension at bay by backing
off from effort⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>so much that I’m barely
keeping the sensation at my nose in the periphery. Every time I get to
around Stage 5, the tension and pain set in, and I have to drop back to

<p>Do you think chanting and mantras are a good adjunct to meditation? I
had a strong spiritual experience with chanting years ago, so I find
myself drawn to it. But as the Stage 3–4 TMI meditator, I wonder if time
for spiritual practice is better spent on getting down to the nuts and
bolts of meditation.</p>

<p>I have an impression that a big part of improving concentrated
meditation has to do with one’s ability to relax moment by moment,
without inviting dullness to the experience. So how does surrendering to
the experience, or to the situation affect one’s ability to go into
deeper stages of meditation? Are there certain stages of meditation
where surrender plays an important role compared to others? Can we only
surrender to experiences which are perceived as negative, but not
enjoyable ones?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you surrender to positive and negative experiences, it has kind
of opposite effects. You can fully enjoy what is pleasurable, without
any attachment. As soon as some attachment develops, it’s palpabale how
the degree to which you can fully experience it declines.</p>
<p>Same thing with an unpleasant experience. As soon as you begin to
cling to it, you feel the <i>dukkha</i> associated with that increasing
in severity.</p>
<p>When the Buddha gave instructions on the Second Noble Truth, he
basically suggested to the bhikkus that he was speaking to, you try
this, any time you experience a strong unpleasantness or pain, just
simply surrender to it, and you’ll see that most of the suffering
associated with it goes away. […]</p>
<p>When you experience pleasant things as a worldling, just as when you
experience unpleasant things, you generate that second arrow of
suffering. When as a worldling, you experience pleasant things, you
create a lot of craving in association with it, and craving is basically
suffering. So you mute the enjoyment, and you interfere with the
enjoyment that would be a natural part of a pleasant experience.</p>
<p>If you surrender to it, then there’s nothing there. So you experience
it exactly as it is. No more, no less.</p>

<p>I had a deep insight experience many years ago. As it has matured, I
felt an increasing ambivalence toward meditation. It’s less that my mind
is actively resisting it, and more that it just doesn’t see how it will
help cultivate further insight. I can see how it might help refine my
concentration skills, but that is a different story. Through listening
to your previous lectures, Q&amp;A sessions, I’ve come to understand
that at a certain point you seem to advocate that one must increasingy
be out in the world rather than in a cave. To me this implies that the
effectiveness, and therefore the importance of formal meditation must
diminish at a certain point on the spiritual path, namely after one
gained stream entry. Can you please comment on this?</p>

<p>Can you talk about the lack of motivation for formal sitting
meditation? Even after many insights, how does it improve my life? I
actually see more and more when I compare myself to other people⁠<span
class="em-dash">—</span>superior, equal or inferior⁠<span
class="em-dash">—</span>and I succeed more and more in seeing this
comparison as suffering, unstable and empty of Self, and this has
lessened, and continues to lessen my stress immensely, and has opened
many doors for compassion with others that feels more connected and
natural. I find it very easy to let go of gross suffering; it is like an
automatic process. Still, I’ve almost lost my motivation to meditate,
and concentrate the mind. I always thought I was not skilled at
concentration, but before the insights, my mind was really calm and
workable, so I have that potential when my mind finds something
pleasurable or useful. I rationally know that the mind was better than
the one that I have now. I still have a lot of desire for sense
pleasure, but I don’t feel motivated to use effort to get there.</p>

I read in the <i>Majjhima Nikāya</i> that the Buddha says that sensual
pleasures give little gratification, and much suffering and distress,
and they are all the more full of drawbacks. Even though an noble
disciple has clearly seen this with right wisdom. So long as they don’t
acheive the rapture and bliss that are apart from sensual pleasure and
unskillful qualities, there’s something even more peaceful than that,
they might still return to sensual pleasures. But when they do acheive
that rapture or bliss, or something more peaceful than that, they will
not return to sensual pleasures.</p>

<p>In meditation, it occured to me the degree to which guilt creates a
strong attachment to Self. Any means to resolve the guilt by means of
apology or confession is an extremely selfish act. Although it can be
appropriate, it is not necessarily for the other person. It is more
about desiring to have things be different, to not feel badly etc.
Intellectually, I can see that guilt will only fade away when it is seen
through, and the circumstances are allowed to be just as they occurred.
Can you offer any suggestions on how to work with guilt as an aspect of
craving and desire, and its inherent means of clinging to Self?</p>

<p>I have only recently noticed that when practicing Stages 4–6, I was
blocking my thoughts. I did let them come, but not let them be. But I
didn’t know that I was doing that, and it was very draining, a big
source of anxiety. Attention without awareness puts too much feeling of
control as thought <i>I</i> have to do with everything, and this paradox
is not nice. Not to mention what people were saying. When this happened
in practice, I thought I was reengaging with the breath, but actually I
think I was not, it only felt like so.</p>
<p><a

With that in mind, I started to allow them to be there, and the very
first session of doing it was full of good feelings and also positive
changes in daily life even though attention did not seem quite strong,
and things are better overall.</p>
<p>But regarding my practice, it seems that when I allow those thoughts
to be there, two intentions are conficting. It looks like to know what I
am allowing, and placing attention in them, so it conflicts with my
intention to attend to the breath.</p>

<p>I’ve been practicing around Stage 6 for some time, but seem to be
struggling with metacognitive introspective awareness. While my plain
old introspective awareness is relatively strong, and I’m aware of most
of my thoughts before they have a chance to turn into gross
distractions, it’s still very much awareness of the content of my
thoughts. I don’t seem to be consitently able to be aware of just a
thought arising without knowing its content, or indeed activities of the
mind in general. I’m trying to hold the intention to observe states and
activities of my mind, but maybe I’m doing it wrong.</p>

<p>For the past few years, I’ve been aware of feeling vibrations
throughout various parts of my body when I’m not meditating. These
vibratory sensations are most prominent in my feet, hands, but also felt
throughout my extremities and trunk. They become most prominent when I’m
sitting, standing still or lying down. For many years, I’ve also felt a
sort of burning sensation at the tips of my fingers, sometimes when I
start to urinate. These sensations are different from the <i>pīti</i>
sensations that I experience sometimes as a sort of showers, or locally
in my head, back or throughout my body. Sensation of <i>pīti</i> is like
tingling, or bubbles bursting. The sensations that are aroused with
yawning and sneezing are very similar to the tingling during meditation.
My question is, what should I do with the sensations when I’m not
meditating? Should I continue to put my awareness at breathing at the
nose, and just keep these sensations in peripheral awareness?</p>

<p>I’ve recently learned a technique to release negative emotional trace
reactions, habits, and emotional reactions as they evolve, called
dismissing, and coming from a non-dual tradition of inquiry. I’d had
great success in relieving severe back pain, and abdominal pain, and
diarrhea using this method.</p>
<p>Dismissing technique instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose the emotion or emotional reaction to a situation you want to
clear</li>
<li>Let yourself feel that emotion now</li>
<li>Locate the physical sensation on the central channel of the
torso⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>a fist-sized tube running from neck
to pelvis</li>
<li>Connect deeply to the sensation of it there, put all your attention
there</li>
<li>Dismiss it. Apply your will and intention, and say to it
respectfully, and with compassion, “Thank you. Your job is completed. I
no longer need you. You may release deeply. You can leave now.”, or like
that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually one can realease any concentrated sensation causing
discomfort felt in the core, and eventually anywhere else in the body.
There are many variations on it such as dismissing sense of
powerlessness, smallness, resistance, and reference to the I, me, or
mine related to the emotion or situation.</p>

might work within your TMI explanatory framework.</p>

<p>Do you think math can help the modern world to fully adopt the
dharmic worldview? How might fully awakened beings, assuming they can
acquire the relevant skills, use the precise language of mathematics,
and the systematic processes used in science and engineering to
facilitate our society in adopting a precise and systematic education
system that might have the chance of being able to facilitate the most
optimal integration of the dhamma on a global scale? For the sake of
adding context to this question, I personally grew up with no spiritual
views relating to suffering, and the end of suffering, unity, suchness

the dharma. As an aside, I wonder why it was that mathematics was able
to arrive at such profound conclusions as well. I couldn’t help but
wonder if this gateway to the dharma could be designed in a systematic
way and be used to help spread the dharma in our modern age.</p>

<p>Recently I had the insight that stillness gives way to silence not
through the abscence of sound, but rather as one is unmoved by change.
Acutely aware of the everpresence of change which has given rise to
fear. There is the knowing that what there is to let go of is
essentially nothing. Just thoughts that create separateness, and the
ideat that a <i>me</i> exists, and that what there is to surrender to is
becoming everything.</p>
<p>I would appreciate any suggestions that you might have as a way to
work with this in sits. Currently I stay completely present to whatever
is arising, and just watch it until it passes.</p>

<p>As a result of the learned technique to release repetitive negative
emotional grasping traces as felt sensations of tension or contraction
anywhere in the body, my experience of <i>pīti</i>, which was formerly
patchy and transient, comes more frequently, persistently and
extensively on and off the cushion. I discovered a place somewhere
around the throat such that when attention is placed there, it really
augments the <i>pīti</i> in those dimensions. Would giving more
attention to this location be helpful to lead to using the pleasure of
<i>pīti</i> as a pathway into <i>jhāna</i> or access concentration?</p>

<p>I usually practice a Goenka technique of <i>vipassanā</i> because I
have access to this where I live. The whole promise of this techique of
<i>vipassanā</i>, as you know already, is that everything that we intend
of we do is stored in our body as sensations, and if we observe them
with equanimity, we can eradicate the old actions that we took. Using
the technique of body-scanning is how they do it. When I did some
research, I realized that none of the sutras by Buddha mention the
technique of body-scanning anywhere. What are your thoughts about this
technique of <i>vipassanā</i>?</p>

<p>Follow-Up: The reason I asked this question is, when doing the
technique of body-scanning and observing sensations, do we develop the
kind of insights that we are meant to develop? Is this an actual insight
technique, or is it more of a <i>śamatha</i> technique? I think that
doing this technique we are developing a better concentration, and
<i>vipassanā</i> would be more into developing insights. Do you think
it’s possible to develop insights in this way?</p>

<p>My mind seems to grasp hard at whatever my attention is on, leading
to painful tension. I never seem to have much of any strong dullness
because when my introspective awareness notices dullness, instead of
getting sleepy, my muscles seem to automatically tense up in order to
force sensation. I have to keep the intention to not tense up, or I
tense up. Occasionally I get into a great place where I’m relaxed and
have really clear sensation and stable attention (Stage 4–5), but before
long I notice that the painful tension snuck in, and my breathing is
very controlled. Is there a specific technique to learn to regulate
effort? How do I let go if any hint of doing so immediately causes
tension that stays with me even off the cushion?</p>

<p>I have a purely practical question. I’ve decided to take a year off
until I start graduate school next September, to focus on meditation. I
have a few retreats planned, and I will be ramping up my practice time
from my current 3 hours a day to about 5 or 6 hours a day.</p>
<p>Given this time budget, how should I schedule my daily practice?
Should I allocate one continuous five-hour block for practice each day,
alternating walking and sitting, or should I split this up into smaller
periods throughout the day? Would you have any other advice on how I can
best use this year for Awakening?</p>

<p>I hear a lot of terms used such as <i>The Four Noble Truths</i>,
<i>Ten Fetters</i>, <i>Awakening</i>, <i>Enlightenment</i>,
<i>nibbāna</i> and so on, many explaining their own interpretations of
what they mean. I could say, intellectually I have a vague understanding
of what this terms or interpretations are pointing to. However, the more
work I do, the more I realize that I don’t actually <em>know</em> much
at all. It’s as though these terms and interpretations are becoming so
distant. This distancing seems strongly linked with the slightly better
embodiment as though I can’t yet reference them fully to my current felt
experience of reality. So leading on from this, the questions below
might have already been answered before. However, I’m curious as to
their answers from a more embodied perspective.</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmg-SOl9Sk4&amp;t=4m14s">00:04:14</a>
Can you clearly define or redefine your present understanding of
<i>Awakening</i> from a more embodied perspective? What actually is it,
and how does it feel? What are its benefits?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is very difficult to put into words what it is like to be awakened
because words and anything that they refer to, they belong to the world
of appearances.</p>

perspective.</p>

Once <i>nibbāna</i> and a practitioner rests in this state more
permanently, does that mean that there’s no more shadow work remaining,
and that everything is known, seen and integrated such that we will not
fall victim to our shadow parts influencing how we create and express in
this world via thought, gesture and physical health and well-being and
so on?</p>

<p>Done many three-day retreats, meditated about 3–5 hours per day,
reached a very quite state similar to what you call bliss of physical
pliancy. No more organic sensation, but very pleasand energy all over
the body. In that state, there’s hardly any more personal thoughts, but
quite a few hypnagogic mental situations like impersonal thoughts,
images etc., which at the same time helped me to get deeper into the
meditation state as long as I keep my metacognitive awareness very
clear. Otherwise I would get very sleepy, or develop dullness. You do
not mention hypnagogia in your book, but those hypnagogic images are
always present in my meditations, and as I said are very helpful to
reach that bliss state.</p>

<p>Follow-Up: Once when I was in India, I went to a place where
donations were being given to this one swami. There were pictures all
around of him, and he came in with a security guard that had a gun in
his holster. I have to admit, that I had developed somewhat of a
prejudice against this person that seemed to be so full of ego. But at
one point, I could feel his consciousness probing my mind, and my
reaction when that happened was, “Boy, you have a great big ego!” And
right after that I was told to get out of the ashram.</p>
<p>My question is, is that part of a larger mind experience, I guess
some sort of telepathy.</p>

<p>When I experience the breath with the body, I can find subtle
sensations in any body part with enough diligence. However I find that I
can internally draw energy through any body part, and this relays a very
tangible feeling. The feeling is like air swishing through a wind
tunnel, very much a suction feeling as if you were drawing water into a
syringe. It is quite pronounced, and I can produce a feeling on command
through my whole body, but specifically through any part of my body. I’m
wondering what I’m doing here, and if I should be doing it.</p>

rise to the experience of emotions and perception of pain/heartache

sometimes as though my head were dull and somebody were kneading it. I

immediately go into first <i>jhāna</i>, then the second <i>jhāna</i>,
third <i>jhāna</i>, and the up and down of that.</p>

unified state, or to begin inquiring into the impermanent, unsatisfying

<p>Is this correct? One solution to the shadow issue on fourth path is
developing a practice that replaces the <i>dukkha</i> feedback mechanism
largely absent, but it seems not entirely absent on fourth path, with
some emotional subtle energy feedback mechanism in conjunction with
psychotherapy. What might be the core elemnts or techniques that such a
solution should consist of, and could a comprehensive solution be some
kind of practice that viewed intention from a purely cause-and-effect
perspective? In other words, to internalize a sort of cognitive and
energy network alert system which alerted conscious awareness to the
subtlest energies and intentions that may be deviating from the dharma.
Some intention recognition systems in which the mind was primed to
recognize when its intention is being deviated from⁠<span
class="em-dash">—</span>not because of <i>dukkha</i> or craving being
present, but simply because the results of forming an action around such
an intention would result in consequences that are <em>knowingly</em>
contradictory to its comprehensive and evolving models of the
dharma.</p>

that I feel comfortable with <i>pīti</i>-<em>jhāna</em> (at least the

reach access concentration, I naturally feel the joy, and therefore do
not work any more on the <i>nimitta</i>, but focus on joy and rapture.

<p>As before, the yogi should react to the awareness rather than to the
distraction, and should do so with a feeling of satisfaction, but the
awareness is there⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>of confidence that the
mind is becoming well-trained. But if it is a larger area (think of it
in your mind as just a single location, not as a series of separate
locations that the breath is moving over in a sequence).</p>
<p>From the first, I have noticed that rather than seeing my alternating
attention as distractions getting in my way, using this as a moment for
appreciation that my awareness is on was actually helpful in keeping it
on with stable attention. Before, I would be aware of every moment of
alternating attention I had, and even though I should not bother with
them until Stage 6, they had a sticky effect on my attention. So I
actually had the urge to manually direct attention many times, and it
was tiring to keep repeating it. I also lack dealing with it in a

which is also helpful.</p>

<p>I have noticed that I was actually focusing on a defined location,
but within that location there would be these separate smaller ones. I
think this had an effect on my breath, which was not continuous, but
rather was happening in bursts of resistant movements which disrupted
this cycle. This would happen especially on my out-breath and in the
pause, so I would have difficulty identifying a pause because there
would be an extra out-breath to feel something. I’ve only seen this post
today, and after trying it seemed to be correlated with focusing
location. But I need to make sure of it through practice, and also get
used to using this.</p>

<p>I’ve tried a few things which seemed to have helped, like meditating
in the morning, making sure I’m well-hydrated, and actually have some
light breakfast to make sure my brain does not starve. That being said,
I’m concerned I might be mistaking exhaustion for simple dullness,
although it does not feel like so, and that it may be best for me to go
back and train my brain against strong dullness some more before
continuing in Stage 5.</p>
<p>Edit: I think it’s actually hunger. In today’s sitting, I started to
hyperventilate, and I got a bit of a headache. I might need to eat more
breakfast.</p>

<p>How should somebody cultivate joy in Stages 5, 6 and 7, whilst at the
same time putting effort into the cognitively demanding tasks of
overcoming subtle dullness and sustaining exclusive attention? Is it a
simple case of continuing to notice pleasant aspects of the meditation
as recommended in the chapter on Stage 2, or is there a different
approach to cultivating joy that starts to happen here⁠<span

joy that comes from a more unified mind?</p>

<p>How much attention should one give to things like slouching. I’ve had
a slouch for most of my life. I try to sit up straight when I’m
meditating, but then I notice I’m slouching, and so I pull myself up.
Should I be making such an effort to keep my posture straight, or should
I let it do its thing?</p>

<p>There is the knowing of emptiness and form with accompanying
equanimity. As compassion continues to expand there is the knowing that
there is ony interconnectedness. How might one now approach boundaries
within context of the human experience? Is it even possible to set
boundaries from the state of interconnectedness without re-entering the
state of separateness and duality? If one is living as pure intention
there is nothing to do other than to allow for the unfolding. It seems
as though the mere fact of suchness and causality render any boundaries
unnecesssary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] I’ve recently found the three natures of the Yogācāran school
very very valuable.</p>
<p>The illusory nature is not ultimately real. But the <em>apparent</em>
nature is ultimately real, and the ultimate nature is ultimately
real.</p>
<p>And so we go from recognizing the illusory nature as illusory and the
ultimate nature as real to the more difficult place of the complete
falling away of the illusory nature, and experiencing the ultimate
reality of the apparent nature as ultimate reality as well.</p>
<p>So form <em>is</em> emptiness, and emptiness <em>is</em> form.</p>

<p>A few months back I asked you about meditating with ADHD and how I
was able to stay on the breath for a while in Stage 4, but then a major
distraction would come. And you suggested just to move on, and not try
to get a ten-minutes period of stable attention.</p>
<p>So I’ve been doing that, and I’ve been doing more Stage 6 practices.
I noticed with the whole-body breathing that it feels like alternating
attention most of the time between the breath at the nose and related
sensations in the body. Is that the case? I’m having trouble separating
awareness and attention.</p>

<p>When I reach mental pliancy or am on the way to, I have quite a few
hypnagogic mental situations (like impersonal thoughts, images etc.)
which at the same time help me to get deeper into the meditation state
as long as I keep my awareness very clear. Otherwise I would get sleepy
or fall into dullness. You barely mentioned hypnagogia in your book, but
those hypnagogia are always present in my meditations, and as I said are
very helpful to reach that bliss state. They can also be used to go
faster into <i>jhānas</i>. I also practice lucid dreaming.</p>

<p>When I get into a <i>jhāna</i> state (the pleasure one, not the
luminous one), I can really see the difference between first, second and
third <i>jhānas</i>. But when I reach the fourth one it gets really
strange. The flow of energy in my body gets so strong that I can’t feel
my body anymore. I can’t do a body scan because there is nothing to
scan. I already had some experience with the formless <i>jhānas</i> of
infinite space and infinite consciousness, but what I really feel is a
very strong increase in the flow of energy. I remember how in Stage 9
you say that it’s important to control the flow of energy, which I have
trouble differentiating the higher <i>jhānas</i> because the flow of
energy is so strong.</p>

<p>At first these waves started below my buttocks⁠<span

these waves not just below me, above me and inside of me, but they are

<p>These wave-like sensations together with the <i>jhāna</i> bring me
into a state where my body feels like a puff of air, like a cloud. In my
mind, I’m very aware of the no-thought state; it’s very clear to me. And
then I have this sensation as if this cloud-like state, if I can call it
that, is leading me into a deeper state. I feel a primal fear in this
state, but it’s not like, “No no no, I don’t want to do that”, it’s
like, “Oh yeah, I want to do that”. I was a mountain climber, so I know
this fear very well⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>it’s an exciting kind
of fear. But that little second of fear is enough to pull me back. I
don’t know if I should work on this fear and then go for it, or if I
should heed the fear, and kinf of wait it out.</p>

<p>I’m practicing in Stage 3–4. I wonder if you could talk about the
<em>feelings</em> of awareness. My understanding is that awareness is a
subconscious process that doesn’t <em>feel</em> like it is me like
attention does. At least for spontaneous awareness like the a-ha moment
after forgetting, I don’t feel like I have done anything. Similarly, I
often get an a-ha moment for a subtle to gross distraction while I’m
still focusing on the breath, which I understand is continuous
introspective awareness. And I get the feeling that “someone else” has
brought to my attention that there was a distraction present. However I
also had a few episodes of what I thought was metacognitive
introspective awareness, and that one did feel like I was both the one
watching the breath, and the one watching the one watching the breath.
Was that then not metacognitive introspective awareness or is it that
feeling around awareness change as the practice progresses?</p>

<p>There’s so much emphasis on describing things that arise as
distractions, and feeling negative about getting distracted. Whereas the
observation that when one sees, or is aware that one is distracted, that
exactly the kind of metacognitive awareness that one is constantly
trying to develop⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>to catch oneself in
absent-minded habitual thought patterns. That is sort of the primary
skill that we are trying to develop.</p>
<p>For me, it’s easier to distinguish or look at distractions, wherever
they arise, as a process⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>as opposed to
trying to be aware of the content of the process. So just seeing them as
processes for me helps to disidentify with those.</p>

<p>I’ve been reading this book by Jan Frazier, <i>The Freedom of Being:
At Ease with What Is</i>. You’ve talked of attentional behavior as it
being an evaluation of our relationship with an object we are attending
to. Is it good for us, bad for us etc. But first there is peripheral
awareness, which is not analyzing, but just being aware of what is
arising. She talks about that evaluating part of attention as being the
ego-attention, and I almost get the idea that she is identifying that
peripheral awareness as being like the Witness. And I was curious what
your thoughts were about comparison or contrast between the Witness and
peripheral awareness.</p>

<p>I know Jan Frazier. Her two main practices were devotion practice and
chanting, And mindfulness⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>just being aware
of everything all the time: everything she was doing, what was
happening, and she woke up. And it’s interesting because when she
expresses herself in her writings, it can sound very Buddhist, but she
doesn’t know anything about neuroscience, and she hasn’t figured out the
attention–awareness thing. So the languaging can get a little confusing,
although she is very clear.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my question. Neuroscientists know that there are
two different parts of the brain, and that attention and awareness are
not the same. And yet in the Theravādan tradition, people may have heard
it, or read about it, or read your book, but it’s not really working its
way into meditation practice very much as far as I can tell. At least in
American Insight meditation societies. Only little bits of it, but it
seems so important. And I’m wondering if there are any more conferences,
or conversations or anything where people are trying to address
this.</p>

<p>I’ve had this general experience that so many of these methods
(whether Buddhist or Advaita, or even those that are related to trauma
therapy, or Feldenkrais) all use different vocabulary, but they all talk
about the same processes. It seems that people have attractions to
different kinds of metaphors, they all being incomplete, they all being
stories, all having that universal property of emptiness, but they all
point to similar things. So it becomes like a process of trying to
internally translate, or at least trying to maintain an awareness of how
they are all pointing.</p>

<p>Would you mind saying a bit more about the difference between
discerning, preference and craving like you brought up in the question
before. And maybe what your experience is around being able to observe
craving without moving into it, and what that might entail, different
ways of doing that.</p>

<p>I was wondering if you could expand on what you said earlier about
the importance of <i>metta</i> in our practice. You even mentioned this
in the book. Perhaps you could say more about why you feel it’s such a
fundamental and critical practice to engage in.</p>
<p>I might have a second part to that question. My experience with
<i>metta</i> has not been very fulfilling, and I developed somewhat of
an aversion to it because I find that it’s like I’m trying to create
feelings that aren’t there. Which I think you mentioned in the book: it
feels artificial to me. Perhaps you could talk about that as well.</p>

<p>How to deal with being both dull and distracted at the same time?</p>
<p>I am practicing at Stage 3–4, and a couple of sessions at Stage 5.
I’ve made a lot of progress stabilizing my attention to the point where
I couldn’t really see how a distraction could ever capture my attention
again. That’s a silly thought!</p>
<p>The sessions would usually go like this: lots of distractions, few
distractions, no distractions, and vivid sensations; then the dance with
dullness, on which I was making progress, but haven’t fully mastered to
reach the end of Stage 4. For the past month, however, the sessions
don’t have the same sequence. They are now all the time full of
distractions⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>like Stage 2 type where I
have so little introspective awareness that there is mind-wandering.
Plus it feels like there is very strong dullness from the very start:
sensation aren’t vivid anymore, but never wanting to go to sleep either.
Dullness antidotes don’t shake it off⁠<span
class="em-dash">—</span>including putting my hand in a bowl of icy
water⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>and create even more
distractions.</p>
<p>I’ve tried the opposite, and tried something new like guided
meditation, or trying to do long periods of checking in. Novelty helps,
but usually wears off very quickly. I’m now a bit worried because
sessions are really uncomfortable, which then leads to resistance.</p>
<p>Is this a common issue? Should I stick to Stage 2 practice, or would
you recommend something else? I know it’s very hard to diagnose while
I’m not present, but any advice would be appreciated.</p>

<p>I’ve been practicing for 15 years, and it really has felt like a
slog. And there’s very little in the way of pleasantness, and I’ve made
what I objectively think to be very little progress. But I’m a little
confused. I’m really eager to hear you say that, and I want to learn how
to do that.</p>
<p>If I’m practicing at Stages 2–3 right now, and the object of my
attention should be the sensations of the breath. But when you say,
“Focus on the other feelings of pleasantness”, does that mean leave the
sensations of the breath?</p>
<h4 id="section-311"><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL36yVnWcb8&amp;t=18m34s">00:18:34</a></h4>
<p>When we were talking about that balance between attention and
awareness, I think that example that you use in the book of visual focus
vs. peripheral vision is one of those ones that is very useful because
we already have experience with it that we can trust. We know what the
felt experience of that is. So doing something as simple as holding up
your thumb, and placing your attention on that, and understanding that
you can do that and be simultaneously aware of the space and the objects
in the background is a feeling of that same king of thing that we’re
trying to experience.</p>
<p>I also think that it can be particularly useful to be available to
the feeling of pleasure in that moment where we have woken back up from
mind-wandering. That moment when we’re lucid again. Because the person
who asked the question talked about resistance, and that’s a form of
contraction⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>of awareness, but that’ll show
up in the body as well. And so in that moment of lucidity when we
suddenly realize, “I’m present”, there can be, and probably will be if
we’re able to be open, a moment of pleasure. A moment of lack of
contraction in the body. Some people who have a particularly strong
somatic response there, can really feel this, and benefit from this.</p>

<p>You talk about walking meditation being good for developing
extrospective attention. I haven’t being doing walking meditation at the
early stages, but now I’m experimenting with it, and finding it a great
practice because of the whole fact that it allows your awareness to
develop.</p>
<p>When you were answering an earlier question in this Q&amp;A session,
you said that you would like to talk to talk one on one of them, and ask
them additional questions. What would be your recommendation to someone
who needs to develop that awareness.</p>
<p>For me, awareness started spontaneously developing at Stages 5–6, and
then I finally clearly understood what awareness was. And possibly, it
would have happened sooner if I were under your tutelage at that
point.</p>
<p>Since you mentioned walking meditation, would that be your primary
advice for someone to develop awareness?</p>

just higher density of sensory perceptions of what’s around me? Or is it

<p>As one works throught Insights, and has incomplete realization of
them, and the Self thins and starts to become absent sometimes, at least
in my experience, fear can become a significant challenge. I’m finding
that with the fear comes a very strong conviction that one is a separate
Self, and that Self is in danger in some way.</p>
<p>So I was wondering how fear looks as you start to move into stream
entry and the different paths. If you fully see through the Self, and
realize that it’s not a separate entity, I wouldn’t think the fear could
really be there⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>although I know there’s
some oscillation even with some of these realizations.</p>

<p>I’ve been meditating almost daily for almost a year. My sits usually
last about 20 minutes, and sometimes up to an hour. I believe I’m around
Stage 4. When I’m really focused, I tend to feel some sort of tingling
sensation on my right ear as if it was swollen and vibrating. The more
focused I feel, the stronger it gets. By more focused I mean wider
awareness and more stable attention. Sometimes I even get it on both
ears, or it starts crawling to the back of my head. At some point, I
started feeling this energy even when I’m not meditating. I asked my
partner if it was indeed swollen or if there was anything strange with
it, and she said it looked normal. Can this sustained feeling be a sign
of <i>pīti</i>? I’m reluctant to believe it as I also believe I’m in
Stage 4. Even if in good sits I get a few gross distractions, I still
get them. Sometimes they even throw me into forgetting and
mind-wandering. Maybe I’m in Stage 2–3. Ha-ha! The cool thing about
these sensations in the right ear is that I get a very direct and clear
feedback about how focused I am, and can thus correct more easily.</p>

begin to explore, and begin to notice any sense of well-being or
pleasure that is associated with <i>pīti</i>, because we’re also talking
about rapture and bliss, and the beginning of the <i>jhānas</i>. If this
is beginning even earlier, with TMI, all along we’re looking for the
pleasantness of the sensations that are arising. Could you say a little
bit more about the art of doing that with <i>pīti</i> and these

<p>I’m having trouble with dullness. In some sessions I constantly have
to do the technique of pursed lips and the breathing technique. But I’m
trying to increase the length of my sessions, so when I get to 30–35
minutes sometimes I even have to get up and maybe even do some yoga
movements to try to wake up. I’ve tried two things which have been
interesting. One is forcing thoughts to appear. It felt a little bit
like a noting technique, maybe. I don’t know. But it worked. I don’t
know how productive it was for my progress on the path, but the dullness
subsided. The other thing, which I’ve been trying for the last couple of
days, is maintaining spatial awareness of my immediate environment.
Which also helps me to remind myself what I’m doing. This is something
that I do throughout the day, and it’s a magnificent experience, which
is something I didn’t realize before. Every time I get this awareness of
the immediate environment I’m in, my breathing picks up again.</p>

<p>My question is about the use of volition/will to generate
concentration. I understand will/volition as an act of choice, even
forceful choice, to pay attention to the breath and pushing the desires
and aversions into the background. The stronger the desire/aversion, the
more force of act of choice is needed. This helps me to keep track of my
breath. After a while the mind shifts into a state where the active
effort is not needed anymore, and the background noise has disappeared
or considerably reduced. However this seems like a strategy to force
desires and aversions out of consciousness temporarily because when I
come out of a meditation sitting, it’s not so effective to use this
strategy. I also get a sense that this strategy makes the desires and
aversions stronger when they return. Is this use of volition to generate
concentration counterproductive.</p>

<p>I’m doing a ten-day retreat and I started contemplating No-Self,
finding the Still Point, realizing the Witness. I began to experience
panic-like fear, my heart started racing like crazy. I had a feeling
like something big and terrifying was about to happen. It got so intense
that I couldn’t handle it, and I had to stop meditating. I happened
twice during the last two days of the retreat and only during
<i>anattā</i> contemplations. This is the first time something like this
happened to me during meditation, so it was totally unexpected. What
would you advise in this situation? How can I work around this fear if
it arises again in daily practice? Or is No-Self contemplation too early
for me? After I stopped meditating, the fear subsided rather quickly,
and I was back to normal. But in both cases I could not continue
meditating and had to stop.</p>
<p>To give you some context of my practice. I was between Stages 7 and 8
before the retreat. Some days I could acheive effortlessness, but it was
not consistent. Then by the fourth day of the retreat, I was
consistently having effortless concentration. By the end of the retreat,
I would often get meditative joy and <i>pīti</i>, and bodily sensations
were rather faint, and then almost absent from awareness.</p>

I’m having trouble finding my meditation object. I find myself
overwhelemed by this turmoil of really violent contractions and
pressures around my face and forehead, emotionally charged with
frustration, mental noise, fogginess and confusion. And it also feels as
if all this area is numb, blank as it’s physically impossible to sense
the sensations of the breath. I believe this is due to a really
intensive surgery that I had in this area of my head when I was a
newborn baby, and my therapist believed that it created a huge trauma.
It may have something to do with <i>pīti</i>. I also wonder if I should
be reading Stages 5 and beyond even though I’m still at Stage 4.</p>

<p>I feel like every micromovement that one makes is filled with
aversion, and as long as metacognitive awareness and joy is present,
suffering is reduced. My strategy is to slow down my movements. That
instantly helps me to keep track of body awareness and joy at the same
time. It stabilizes mindful awareness. I experience an instant 10 times
reduction in suffering and radical increase of jhānic stability of joy
in my mind. But my negative impatient habits are so pervasive that I
forget this often in daily life. Even as I’m typing this comment, I do
feel the joy with metacognitive awareness, but I also feel this nagging
urge to finish this sentence and get this over with. I can see the
aversion in those subliminal intentions, and I have to work with them.

<p>Recently, I heard about the direct path of <a

confusion because all of these non-duality teachers like <a

it seems as if there is no need to train the mind to reach the ultimate
goal of Awakening, and I’m losing motivation and clarity on why should I
keep working on a progressive approach like TMI even though I already
experienced amazing benefits out of it. Can you please bring some
clarity onto the relationship between the so-called direct path and
progressive path? How do they integrate within the bigger picture of the
awakening path?Why should we focus on one or the other?</p>

<p>I’ll be explaining my practice in more detail for this reason. First
of all, due to TMI, I’m feeling a consistent sensation of pleasure
around the sides of my head area. This has been going on every day to
varying degrees for more than 12 months. I feel like this has become an
easily accessible joyful mental state as long as I’m mindful. I’m not
sure which brain circuits are producing what chemicals, but what I know
is that it completely eliminated severe and stable negative emotional
mind states like depression, shyness and anxiety. If I focus on it, I
can maintain it with mindfulness. If I wing it, I can lose this
pleasure, but the moment I direct my awareness towards my head, the
pleasure reappears. I smile slightly to facilitate it. As a practice, I
stabilize attention to the breath and expand the awareness to this joy,
whole body and mind activities. Or I can direct the attention to the
joy, and expand the awareness to the body and mind⁠<span
class="em-dash">—</span>disregarding the breath in the process. I tend
to direct the attention to the pleasure if I feel instability within it.
Regardless, this enables me to practice effectively and develop
metacognitive awareness. This was so effective that it radically
transformed my life and my entire meditation practice.</p>
<p>As long as I’ve consciously intended to maintain this awareness in
the morning, I can do it with consistent success. But my resolve is not
always so high every single day, and sometimes subtle dullness described
in Stage 5 can appear. I never experienced so much sluggishness where I
feel the need to go to sleep, but I can definitely feel this low-tier
energy with joy where I’m not alert. Comparing that mental state with
how my mind feels increased energy as I’m playing video games makes me
realize the problem of this subtle dullness. But while playing video
games, the downside of that is they tend to lose or feel a sense of
diminishing in the mindfulness, joy, body awareness and introspective
awareness. Even though joy definitely gives me energy, I’m still trying
to bridge the gap between the quality of energy I feel in daily life
with the quality of alertness in formal sitting meditation. What would
you suggest I do?</p>

<p>I want to ask about your thought on whether consistent psychedelic
use is a good idea on the path to Awakening. I’ve never used it, but a
friend of mine extensively uses the substance called <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-MeO-DMT">5-MeO-DMT</a>. He says
that it is a fourty-five times more effective psychedelic than <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N,N-Dimethyltryptamine">DMT</a> and
produces an insight experience, an ego-death so profound that you know
yourself to be God. He says, “You are literally God and you are
infinite”, “Everything is love”, “Death is 100% an illusion”, “Life is a
dream”, “What we experience normally is a controlled hallucination”,
“Materialism is wrong”, “Brain is part of this controlled
hallucination”, “There is no objective external material world”,
“Perception is a part of this hallucination”, “No-Self is a
beginner-level insight”, “Compared to what is possible to realize on
5-MeO-DMT, in normal mediation even TMI will only partially get you to
these states and realizations”. He says that these realizations are
infinite. By using 5-MeO-DMT he claims to realize certain thuths that no
other spiritual master has talked about. Is such a thing possible? Do
you agree with his realizations? I know that you make a distinction
between states and stages, Insight embodiment. My friend says that you
experience these insights, although temporarily on psychedelics, with
1000 times the depth than traditional meditations. And he believes it is
important considering people meditate for 10–20 years with very little
to show for it. He also says that permanent Insight embodiment and
temporary Insight experiences are dualistic notions and they collapse
after the experience of time is seen as an illusion. What advice would
you give to this person?</p>

<p>I join this type of question from a different angle. In an ayahuasca
ceremony, being outside and looking up, I suddenly saw everything⁠<span
class="em-dash">—</span>house, trees, the sky, people, my own
thoughts⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>in a completely different way.
First, everything was luminous, bright, vibrating, a vast space; second,
it appeared and disappeared at an extremely high rate. One could also
say that it was like a water fountain⁠<span
class="em-dash">—</span>solid, and yet not solid. Third, it was like a
giant display. An immense screen that I could look at, but this looking
was subtly different. I kind of had to turn my head, keeping the eyes
fixed. Fourth, it had an emotional quality of endless awe. Fifth, my
mind said, “This is all me”, whereas the me was everything that arose.
This state lasted perhaps for a few minutes. I should add that in the
minutes prior to this, inside my eyes seemed to throw two distinct light
beams to whatever I looked. I could actually enlighten the walls with
bright light at will. This left such an incredible impression that
eventually I picked up TMI, and now I’m reading Tibetan <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bon">Bon</a> instructions translated
by Daniel P. Brown, which to me come closest to express much of that
depth of experience. I had zero prior meditation experience. This
happened at age 63; I’m now 65. I’ve only once re-experienced this state
in a lesser for when looking at night at a water fountain. My meditation
motivation comes largely from these few minutes. Sometimes I experience
a somewhat similar non-dual state when meditating on the autobahn. With
podcasts as my meditation object, with eyes open. However, the
experience of luminosity is then not present. The question is, I am now
pretty convinced that the descriptions I read in, for example, the six
lamps referring to luminosity, brightness, self-driving, vastness of
appearance of phenomena are not just metaphorical. They correspond to
the actual meditative experience. Is that true? Also, the more modest
question is, does this experience without an experiencing individual
Self correspond to some kind of Awakening experience. I have to say that
this experience was more formative for me than many of the other more
symbolic or emotional experiences. I have to add that since I’ve had
these experiences, I am more and more in the state of compassion after
having insights into my own trauma.</p>
<h4 id="section-340"><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8XJrNx7iN0&amp;t=44m17s">00:44:17</a></h4>
<p>I’m a bit confused. Everyone talks about how you can learn from and
get insights from psychedelic experiences. But now, if I understood
properly, what you’re saying is that all of these experiences you go
through, they are just mind-created, they are just more illusions. So
what are you getting Insight into? What are you learning about if it’s
not reality itself? If at the end of the day it’s just another illusion.
How can that be valuable in terms of getting Insight into the actual
reality (if there is such a thing)?</p>
<h4 id="section-341"><a

<p>If we were to open your skull and started to remove parts of the
brain, do you think that at some point we would remove enough so that
these permanent traits would be gone?</p>
<h4 id="section-342"><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8XJrNx7iN0&amp;t=1h2m44s">01:02:44</a></h4>
<p>My question was a proxy to another question which has to do with the
idea of permanence of this shift in perception that happens after
Awakening. The question is can those traits be undone by e.g. actions
that we carry out or habits that we acquire after Awakening? Can
something make those stable traits that we’ve developed unstable
again?</p>

<p>How is Buddhist texts structured and organized? I’m curious how one
goes about reading them. Ideally, I would like to read the text in its
original script and explanations in English. How does one go about
learning Pali, and do you have recommendations for books that discuss
important parts of Buddhist texts?</p>

<p>A good friend of mind is engaged in religious Buddhism, and even
aspires to become a monk. What I say next may be biased in some way, but
I will try to describe my understanding of his path to the best of my
knowledge. My friend interprets the suttas⁠<span
class="em-dash">—</span>early Buddhist texts⁠<span
class="em-dash">—</span>quite literally and believes in reincarnation,
predictable karmic effects on your future lives, heaven and hell realms,
renunciation from the world etc. Also, he thinks that the whole material
world or existence is <i>saṃsāra</i>, that it is bad and something to be
transcended through a spiritual path. Also, for him, an arhat is someone
who is also practically perfect in his conduct. I recommended your book
to him, but he does not believe that you are an arhat. Because of the
recent allegations, he will not even read it. How would you advise to
find common ground with such a person? I’m not trying to persuade him. I
just want to have a productive communication about spirituality even
amongst our differences. We spend lots of time together, so having
harmonious communication without arguing constantly is important for me.
Also, if you personally have some thoughts about this literal religious
approach to Buddhism and why you don’t follow it, I’ll be glad to hear
your views.</p>

<p>As I understand it, an arhat is someone whose craving and delusion
has been permanently extinguished as a result of Awakening. And
consequently, there is no more scope for the arising of moment-to-moment
becoming or rebirth. I don’t understand why such an arhat wouldn’t just
let this conventional life end and transition to <i>parinibbāna</i> as a
natural consequence. At the moment, how would the intention arise in the
arhat to get up from the couch and to continue living the conventional
life? Especially if the arhat has not been asked to teach or hasn’t
found interest in people who want to learn?</p>

<p>What is the most common way in which stream entry happens to people?
I am aware of the important distinction between states and traits, and I
ask this question out of pure curiosity. I undestand that one should not
judge whether one is awakened or not because that person had some kind
of experience. Bearing that in mind, did you notice any trends or
commonalities in your students, or people you know?</p>
<p>Here are some questions that make me curious. How often is a stream
entry accompanied by a cessation? Is it usually a sudden realization, or
more gradual and long-lasting event for most people? Does it happen on
the cushion more often, or just randomly in daily life?</p>
<p><a

<p>With regards to the question of free will, and everything being
interdependently connected, a lot of people who are new to meditation
wonder how sitting down and meditating every day is a good use of their
time in terms of making the world a better place. Why not use that time
to go and work for a charity, for example? It comes across as a selfish
thing to do to some people.</p>

<p>When you mentioned you own experienced of stream entry, it reminded
me of in a way similar experience that I had last year on my first
ten-day Goenka retreat. It was sometime in the middle of the retreat, a
few days in. I was already in bed, about to go to sleep, and I had a
similar sense of that I understood everything way deeper, how reality
works at a deeper level. But what struck me, and the reason why I
remembered this was because I had a sense of “This is so obvious to me
right now”, “Of course it’s like this”. And I got excited, but then the
next morning I forgot about everything. So what I’m trying to ask is,
what exactly happened to me? Was I close, or was it some illusion,
fantasy or dream? What would that be?</p>

<p>Would you anticipate that someone who has already cognitively taken
in this idea regarding rules, rites and rituals, who is already living
from a place of virtue rather than simple ethics or morals that they
would still experience a profound shift in that sphere at stream entry,
or do you think that this would be something that would be more
pronounced for someone who was living from rules and morals etc.?</p>

I’m asking because about a month ago, I experienced a sudden drop in
clarity of the object of attention and a decrease in my ability to keep
peripheral awareness wide open. Literally, one day, distractions would
not be able to grab my attention at all during the whole sit; next day,
everything felt slippery and my attention would jump from one thing to
the next. Are these changes common? Do they have to do with something
happening in a different axis of practice?</p>

<p>Do you think that we will be able to use technology to accelerate
Awakening in the foreseeable future? I’ve heard Shinzen Young say that
he really hopes that we will find some way to make meditation easier for
most people using some kind of technology. Personally, I’m worried that
it will be really hard to reach a critical mass of awakened people
because Enlightenment is not easy and takes a long time for most people.
Especially those who don’t have good instructions such as TMI. What are

even cause Awakening⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>both in the near and

<i>In the Theater of Consciousness: The Workspace of the Mind</i>. It
seems that nowadays there is a large consensus about the idea that our
mind works as a distributed mind system rather than an egotist
consciousness. I have two questions about this system:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_gUvXkkVY&amp;t=1h7m9s">01:07:09</a>
It appears that most of information is processed unconsciously. Can we
say that it works better this way? Unless we are in a learning process.
And therefore we should interfere as minimally as possible and try just
to be a witness of our own processes?</p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU_gUvXkkVY&amp;t=1h14m5s">01:14:05</a>
The theater where our moment-by-moment awareness takes place, especially
in meditation, seems to have limited capacity and can track information
almost one-by-one. But it is not that obvious, for instance, let’s say
that I’m focused on my breath with central awareness. If I hear a noise
like a loud-working machine, I feel that I can stay focused on the
breath, and at the same time hear the disturbing noise. Can we say that
the breath remains central or shares the space-consciousness with the
machine noise? Or that it is an illusion and that there is still a
moment-by-moment breath–sound, breath–sound way of processing
information?</p></li>

<p>I feel I’ve been in Stage 4 for months, maybe almost a year. I also
have the impression that my peripheral awareness has been gaining ground
week by week⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>even off the cushion. That
leads me to think that being stuck in Stage 4 is mostly due to the
stability of attention that is lacking, not the strength of the
peripheral awareness. Yet in TMI, I get the feeling that a strong
peripheral awareness will naturally and inevitably produce a stable
attention. I do feel my attention gets more stable when I exert effort,
however that effort does not feel at all relaxed. And TMI says that
relaxation is key for success. Also, when exerting effort, I tend to
drift away from joy into seriousness. During my meditation sessions, I
find it hard to balance relaxation and effort. What would you
recommend?</p>

<p>I’m really curious about psychic powers. I understand that in light
of the purpose of the practice they are not important, but this topic
keeps peaking my intellectual curiosity, so I cannot resist asking about
it. I think I have a firm intellectual understanding and conviction of
your metaphysical views, non-dualism, individual minds not being
separate etc. So I have no doubt that all sorts of mental phenomena are
possible that do not align with the materialistic intuitions of ordinary
people. What psychic powers are possible or you have personally
developed, if you don’t mind me asking. Is reading the minds of others
<i>siddhi</i> real? If so, what is the exact nature of that
<i>siddhi</i>? Can a meditator know the exact content of another
person’s conscious experience (thoughts, emotions etc.) in real

<p>This is a follow-up to a previous discussion that we had in July. I
have had very long and intense meditations lately and was surprised at
how easily I could get into <i>jhānas</i> if I just let things happen. I
realized that I do not need to <em>try</em> to do anything to get
through Stage 2 to Stages 6–7. In fact, anything <em>I</em> do doesn’t
go in the right direction. It seems that when you have built enough
experience over time, inner or unconscious processes work better on
their own. They know how to get you where you need to go, much better
than anything that you try to do consciously. There is a point where any
<em>personal</em> effort can be considered an interference to deepening
your meditation. Would you agree with that?</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwyGPfavfFY&amp;t=1h6m8s">01:06:08</a>
Somehow, naturally I’d fall into <i>jhānas</i>, and I’ve also built
enough experience. They deepen by themselves. The way I feel it, a sort
of energy (<i>śakti</i>, whatever) goes all over my body, and as
<i>jhānas</i> deepen, physical sensations vanish completely, my mind
becomes very quiet until finally my thoughts stop, finally freeing
myself. Then I may wonder, “Do I have to do something to go further, or
should I let things happen?” But I don’t have much experience of going
any further, so what can happen by itself if I don’t do anything, and
remain without much I in that place of bliss and quietness?</p>

<p>My question is about whole-body <i>jhānas</i>. I had an experience a
couple of weeks ago where I used an approach that is a bit different to
what is described in TMI. When I focus on the sensations at the nose, it
can get quite intense. This led me to try a method described in Ajaan
Lee’s <i>Keeping the Breath in Mind &amp; Lessons in Samadhi</i> which
involbes imagining the breath flowing through the body. I believe I kept
doing this until I noticed that a noticeable ease and flow of energy was
achieved. And since you mentioned that joy is part of acheiving
<i>jhānas</i>, I imagined every being experiencing this sensation,
happiness being within themselves. And that was the last thing I
remembered before going into a flow state. It was like my body was
effortlessly being glazed in energy. For the past couple of months,
experiencing sensations at the nose or over the body has been easily
accessible. Sometimes I can dial up or down the intensity. But it is
quite difficult to go into a flow state. Sometimes I wonder if I am
going to explode at any moment. But it just ends up being the experience
for an hour-long sit. During sessions I would sometimes take a break by
focusing on nothing while maintaining quality of awareness before
getting back into intentionally observing sensations. Besides all of the
abovementioned, I don’t know what else to do.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I tried the loving-kindness meditation as it is described
in TMI, which is quite defferent from the Tibetan way. In the Tibetan
way, you imagine the loving of your mother and then you imagine what
suffering is, you develop this sympathy. Whereas what you had is more
like imagining what it’s like to not have any suffering at all. And it
hit the mark very quickly. The Tibetan way is a very traditional way,
and it’s not everybody’s cup of tea. And I felt it didn’t quite hit
home.</p>

<p>I was wondering if you’d be willing to speculate about an experience
that I had when I did a course with Goenka back in around 1973. It was a
self-course, so there was no instruction being given. It was a 30-day
course. We did 10 days of <i>ānāpāna</i> meditation during which I
started having these painful burning toes in both feet like they were in
molten lead. And as soon as I would stop meditating, the pain would go
away, and when I’d start meditating again, it would come back. I think
that to some degree it was a reflection of the degree of concentration
that I had. It was also the first time when I experienced full-body
sensations. It was as though my whole body was exploding with

walking about 6 inches off the ground. Until somebody came with a

lost or something like that. Immediately, I came down. I was curious,
this feeling like I was walking 6 inches above the ground, what do you
think might have happened?</p>

<p>I would like to follow up on my question from last session. I asked
about relaxation and energy or effort. I tried following what I
understood from what you told me last time. Also, something I’ve been
doing is trying to stretch up the spine. I noticed that by doing that I
get some sort of natural energy that feels relaxed. It’s an energy that
doesn’t have this feeling of striving or efforting too much.</p>

<p>During one of the previous Q&amp;A sessions, you mentioned that one
of realizations after deep Awakening is that everything is love. Could
you please elaborate more on that? Why is that the case?</p>
<p>It seems like sentient beings on this planet tend to experience a lot
more suffering than pleasure in life, and now we all potentially face an
anthropological existential threat which could bring even greater
suffering. How can we integrate these facts with the notion that
everything is love? How would you explain it conceptually to a person
who is not yet awakened?</p>

<p>Some religious branches of Buddhism use the fact of suffering to
promote an idea of finishing the endless cycle of reincarnation and
getting out of <i>saṃsāra</i>. To them, living is suffering, and this
whole material world is <i>dukkha</i>, and <i>nibbāna</i> is the way to
get out.</p>
<p>I understand the problems with the notion of reincarnation and how it
was incorporated from Hinduism. You discussed it quite often before, but
is there any value at all in such teachings?</p>
<p>I personally find it repulsive and quite nihilistic to view existence
as bad and something to escape from. However, so many Buddhist schools
and experienced meditation teachers promote this idea, and they are
basing it on the suttas. So I’m feeling quite confused. What is your
opinion on this approach to Buddhism?</p>

<p>As someone who’s been a lifelong spiritual seeker, I have read about
and practiced in different faiths, but finally found what I was looking
for in Buddhism. There’s one aspect that I miss from before, and that is
prayer.</p>
<p>Ironically, I never used to like praying very much, but not that is
not really included in secular Buddhism. I miss it. I know that there
are religious Buddhists who pray to Buddhas and Taras etc.</p>
<p>Could you talk about the place of prayer in early Buddhism and
whether we can still incorporate prayer and chanting in our practices?
Who are we praying to if there is no God and the Buddha was human? Can
we pray for help? Can we get help from or connect to previous Buddhist
masters? I’ve always felt a strong connection to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipa_Ma">Dipa Ma</a> even though I
never met her. How would prayer be explained as working in Buddhist
philosophy?</p>
<p>I know there are a lot of questions here. Essentially, I’m looking
for an overview of prayer from a traditional Buddhist perspective.</p>

<p>Let’s say that you have the realization that you drifted away from
the meditation object, and are coming back celebrating this realization.
However, if the thought that captured your attention was of a dark
nature, will the celebration of coming back connect this achievement in
your brain with the returning to the present, or with the dark
thought?</p>

<p>I’ve been wondering about the similarities between the state of
awareness characterized by the mind at Stage 10, and the mind which is
unsurpassable, and <i>nibbāna</i>.</p>
<p>I’ve just been on a retreat where this thing was touched on. The
teacher discussed the different schools of thought splitting them
clearly between those who believe that there is just consciousness and
those who believe there is something out of which consciousness
arises.</p>
<p>My sense was that it was the latter of these two schools of thought
that could entertain the possibility of gradual Awakening without an
experience of cessation and <i>nibbāna</i>. I’ve been finding it hard to
reconcile my own experience of crossing into what feels like the
territory of stream entry and not experiencing cessation. In TMI you
said that cessation is not at all necessary. I’m wondering why it is
given so much emphasis in other traditions.</p>
<p>It feels like this experience might be a time trap, but I don’t want
to be nonchalant and disregard an experience.</p>

<p>How common is it to be at Stage 9? I’ve been meditating on and off
for 10 years now, but I’ve been with TMI for only the last few years. As
sittings go by, I’m more and more convinced I’m actually at such an
advanced level. It’s quite literally unbelievable to me. The experiences
you describe in TMI match mine to the extent that I can recognize them.
But somehow I expected more. I guess I’m just not perceiving the
day-to-day gradual growth I’m having and that most insights come now at
Stages 9 and 10. Could you comment on this?</p>

practice to be soothing and helpful. In the past I self-medicated with

craving and reaching for those things as antidote for stress. Is there

<p>Depending on the day, I seem to be at Stages 7–8–9. When I get to the
point of effortlessness, I notice that joy arises and I get a lot of
satisfaction if I completely let go and take the entire mind as
meditation object and just sit back and observe. And then every now and
again when anyting arises, noticing e.g. that it contains suffering,
that it’s changing etc., that it’s not me because I’m witnessing it.
That has started to develop a deepening Insight which is really
nice.</p>
<p>What I’m noticing though is that I feel a reluctance to go to the
breath at the nose at all, it feels like I really want to stay in that
expansive state. And I guess, my question is, is it necessary? Or is it
just the case that it’s a season of practice, that I’m just exporing
this and that there will probably come a time when it feels more natural
to go back to the breath sensations at the nose?</p>

<p>In recent sits I’ve been letting go of attention on the breath, and
instead relying on metacognitive awareness to investigate the
Mind-System. I’ve been investigating arising phenomena by noting how
they are constantly changing, how they contain subtle suffering, and how
they are different to the Witness observing it, and so are not me. This
has brought about some very useful Insight.</p>
<p>For example, in my daily life, I seem to identify far less with my
emotions, reactions, thoughts etc. because I know them as mental
formations. I still experience them in much the same way, but I can
relax about them more because I’m more in touch with their emptiness.
However, I think my identification with Self has instead shifted from
these formations to the sense of Self that comes from being a witness to
these phenomena. A kind of neutral observer.</p>
<p>It seems, therefore, that it’s not deepening an insight into No-Self
because I’ve instead just started to identify with a different kind of
separate Self.</p>

<p>It seems like I’m going through Stages 2–7 or 8 during every sit.
First 20–30 minutes of my meditation are usually characterized by
working through Stages 2–4, and by the end of the sit, I’m consistently
at Stage 7, and often Stage 8. I’m wondering, is this okay?</p>
<p>Even though, I’m close to the adept stages, the first half of my
meditation still has a lot of mind-wandering and forgetting, which are
characteristic of earlier stages. I’ve noticed that this process happens
regardless of how much effort I apply. For example, I can sit and relax
for the first 30 minutes, and there will be lots of mind-wandering and
forgetting, but after that I will begin to have a clear mind with lots
of mindfulness, and it will be really easy to stabilize my attention.
The opposite is true, even if I apply lots of effort and diligence, the
beginning of my meditation will still have significant mind-wandering
and forgetting, and then it magically gets really easy to sustain. This
even caused a period of laziness in my practice when I thought, “Why
should I apply all this effort in the beginning if my mind will get much
clearer by itself in half an hour, and it will be really easy to
meditate?” However I recognize this as a hindrance, and now I try to
remain diligent from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Am I doing something wrong? I feel like I’m making progress, but not
as fast as I could. Should I go back to Stages 2 and 3, and focus more
on mastering them? Should I just go with the flow and not worry about
it?</p>

<p>I think I’m kind of a perfectionist with the techniques described in
TMI. I’m talking about Stages 2–3–4. I think I have this feeling that I
haven’t mastered those techniques from the beginning and that stops me
from going further, although I feel that I need some of the techniqes
from the more advanced stages. I have this feeling that I didn’t
complete something, and that I haven’t mastered the earlier stages well
enough to go further. I have this psychological need to stay longer at
the previous stages, although I feel that I need something else. Should
I focus more on the previous techniques, or should I go further even
though I don’t feel that I haven’t completed the earlier stages?</p>

<p>I was thinking about intention. When you set your intention before
you do your sit, you can have a very general intention and a more
specific one⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>what you’re going to do on
that particular sit. I was wondering what you think about the
traditional Buddhist refuge in the Buddha, the dharma and the sangha. I

<p>I’d like to discuss what you call non-perceiving mind moments, which
I think are very important. You said, the more of those moments we have,
the more dullness we experience. Indeed, but behind apparent dullness,
there’s a powerful hypnagogic process that can be used for deepening
meditation.</p>
<p>A non-perceiving mind moment seems like a blank spot in the field of
consciousness. If one looks closer in the past few seconds of the
non-perceiving mind moment, one can find out that it is not empty at
all, that it is filled with hypnagogic perceptions like people talking,
images, sounds etc., and it happens just below awareness at a very
close-to-subconscious level, but with a proper traing it is possible to
bring them into the field of consciousness.</p>
<p>Why do this? Simply because hypnagogia comes with interesting
effects. During a non-perceiving mind moment, the capacity of bringing
it back, the capacity of bringing it back to memory always seems to come
with a narcotic effect consisting of physical anesthesia, dullness,
amnesia and rapture⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>the same rapture that
can be experienced when entering <i>jhāna</i>.</p>
<p>I found out after lots of training in lucid dreaming that
non-perceiving mind moments are like the tip of the iceberg, but
underneath the surface there is everything needed to get rid of physical
sensations (anesthetic effect) and to be filled with joy and rapture,
which is exactly what is needed to enter <i>jhānas</i>.</p>
<p>When non-perceiving mind moments are properly used, it works like a
shortcut to jhanic state, and it works wonderfully well, but it is
essential to control the narcotic effect in order to get anesthesia and
rapture without the dullness and amnesic effect and keep awareness
perfectly clear.</p>

<p>TMI is a wonderful book, but you’ve often said that you couldn’t

have been twice as large. You have an online book recommendations list.
Either from that list, or in terms of books or resources you’ve come

<p>What is the difference between the experience of the Witness, and the
experience of the Self? Is it possible to have non-dull moments of
consciouness where the sensations of the breath are present, but the
Witness is not?</p>
<p>During sittings, I lose track of me and my immediate surroundings,
yet when I am that, it doesn’t feel like I was under subtle dullness. It
feels different. It feels like I was mindful the whole time, even though
the I or the Witness wasn’t there.</p>
<p>I’m challenging the idea of being able to tell when I was mindful or
not a moment ago. Ultimately, “I was mindless just now” can be seen as
just another thought. But it feels risky and weird to assume that we
can’t trust the memory of event thats happened just now as that would
mean having no basis to understand what is going on during meditation in
order to know what antidotes one might want to apply.</p>

<p>Maybe some information about me as a person can be helpful. I’m very
easily distracted⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>work, reading, school
etc.⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>at the same time I can be very
focused and deep-dive when I found a focus. This characteristic seems to
be present in my meditation sessions as well.</p>
<p>For a long time I found myself very easily dragged away from the
breath, mind wandering being the major content of a meditation session.
I’ve been meditating one and a quarter hours per day according to the
instructions of your book for more than 3 years now. I believe myself to
be in Stage 3 according to the classification.</p>
<p>I would say, it took me about a year to reduce cases of
mind-wandering and its duration. Furthermore, the concept of being able
to attend to sensations of the breath, and at the same time realizing
what is going on around me⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>be it thoughts
or feelings⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>seemed unreachable to me. It’s
only very recently that I noticed a change in my meditation sessions,
and I would like to talk to you about it.</p>
<p>It seems that I can attend to the breath, and still realize my stream
of thoughts or feelings, which are there, sometimes more in the
foreground, sometimes more in the background. Sometimes in realizing
these thoughts, I ask myself whether I forgot the breath or not. I
rarely still have short periods of mind wandering when there is a strong
thought or emotion.</p>
<p>I have two questions. I start to realize that when the thoughts are
not coming in as events anymore, but rather exist there all the time in
the background, I rarely label them. I actually only label a thought if
it somehow stands out of the stream of thoughts going on in parallel to
my attending to the breath. Is it okay to not label in that case?</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXySJwIZMP8&amp;t=56m14s">00:56:14</a>
So far, I stuck fairly strictly to the stages of your book, but I
wouldn’t say that I completed Stage 3 as I still sometimes forget the
breath. On the other hand, a clear change has happened to my meditative
experience which I interpret to be linked to a higher level of
introspective awareness.</p>

<p>I’d like to expand a little more on one point that you touched on
during a previous session.</p>
<p>Let’s say that a meditator has a chronic medical condition that
produces symptoms which significantly hinder meditation progress. For
example, brain fog.</p>
<p>As you probably know, it becomes quite hard to stabilize attention in
such a state, and lots of dullness is naturally present. Also, negative
thoughts can arise. Meditation progress is really slow. You are barely
making any progress. You are constantly being kicked back to the early
stages etc. What attitude changes, perspective changes or practical tips
would you advise in such situations so that the meditator can still
continue to progress through the stages without getting demotivated?</p>

<p>Somewhere around February, I was playing around with the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wim_Hof#Wim_Hof_Method">Wim Hof
method</a>⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>hyperventilating. And after a
week I felt my attention was more scattered when I did TMI. I was
probably practicing around Stage 3 at the time, and it took me a week or
two to have a more consistent stable attention. Since then, I never
tried the Wim Hof method again. I’m wondering if these two methods
conflict with each other, and it’s best to stick with one way of
practicing.</p>
<p>One of the things I was taught while learning tantric guru yogas was
that one can either start with deep breathing exercises⁠<span
class="em-dash">—</span>the vase breathing⁠<span
class="em-dash">—</span>or use the common method of following the
breath, but not to do both. Try both, but in the end, you should focus
on one only.</p>

<p>I’m curious to hear you view on the role of longer retreats as part
of the dharma. In TMI you offer teachings that can be incorporated into
a daily routine, and to me this seems to be an integral part of your
teachings. Nevertheless, I notice that retreats for me are spaces where
I can work much more diligently, with much more focus on those practices
and that they often have a positive, long-lasting effect.</p>
<p>I’m curious to know if you consider retreats a necessary part of the
dharma and how it would be best integrated into TMI teachings. I’m
curious about the length of these weekend, week, 3 months and other
retreats that accompany TMI teachings as well.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago, I did a two-week long day retreat at home with
friends. We could make our own schedule, and I tried to follow a bit
more of a structure during that time.</p>
<p>But one challenge that I had is that sitting longer stirred things
up. Part of that might have been integrating new teachings. That is in
contrast with the daily routine that is strongly based in the TMI
practice which gives clear guidelines. I found it challenging to on the
one hand have this daily routine which has lots of structure, and on the
other hand in the retreat setting, where they essentially teach the same
things but use different words and concepts. I think now I’m at a point
where I look back and see that the core of it is very similar, but I
found it challenging to have a different framework of teaching. I’m
curious to hear if that’s just part of the process⁠<span
class="em-dash">—</span>to recognize challenges, to feel a bit unstable
at times if other people use different words. Talking to my friends
helped me to see the similarities, but my question is how do I deal with
different teachings if they all use different words and that always
throws me a bit off balance.</p>

<p>A couple of months ago I asked a question about entering
<i>jhāna</i>. A few weeks later, I re-read Stage 6 trying to see if
there was anything I was missing or overlooked, and then I started
experiencing it again, which happened a couple of times. But then my
daughter was born and it went away.</p>
<p>So it has been a month and a half, and I haven’t experienced it
again. A part of me feels like I’m on a plateau. I think I know the
answer which is that I should just keep practicing it in a systematic
way, but perhaps you could give me some pointers.</p>

<p>Do you have any suggestions about what to do when intense,
emotionally charged thoughts and mental images arise during meditation
and you feel like you don’t have the willpower to move away from that?
It’s just to seducing and alluring. You are aware that you’re there, but
you don’t have the strength to bring the mind out of that and go back to
doing the technique.</p>

<p>I found that when you run into this problem during meditation,
sometimes there isn’t anything you can do, but other times it’s worth to
keep going and I had some good meditations when this happened, but I
could overcome this state. But it takes time⁠<span

<p>I’m practicing between Stage 3 and 4. So far, I’ve never fallen
asleep during a meditation. I’m wondering if this is a sign of me not
having sufficient stable attention. I sure do have the feeling that I
experience subtle dullness, but rather as a precursor to me forgetting
the breath and not as a precursor to falling asleep. I believe that I’m
a very alert person in general. Maybe that will help you to interpret my
observations. Can you please give me some advice? I would be very
thankful to hear whether there is something that I should improve, work
on, or just continue with Stage 3–4 practices.</p>

<p>I’ve been meditating using TMI for around 4 years now. I find myself
stuck in Stage 3–4. I’ve been able to maintain good extrospective
awareness very early, but I’m not able to get a steady introspective
awareness going on. I do practice walking meditation before my sit
almost every day, genearally for 10–15 minutes. At times my meditation
sessions end up creating some anxiety or dullness. I’d like to get your
perspective. Is this something common? What could I do differently to
have a steady introspective awareness?</p>

<p>“The Witness doesn’t exist.” What do you think? I’m coming to that
conclusion. Sometimes I try to get to the place of the Witness, but I
seem to be automatically sprung back out of it. I’m left with a feeling
of “I don’t want to go back there anymore”. It brings back memories of
some bad trips I had where I felt paralyzed (not physically), and my
mind would spin in circles trying to make sense of the experience where
other non-meditation could just “go with it”. I guess identification
with the Witness and psychoactive drugs doesn’t mix well. Would love to
hear your opinion.</p>

<p>When I meditate, sometimes my awareness goes off into memories and
thoughts, then there is a point when I come back, and there is this
experience of selfness, ego. Same thing happens when I wake up in the
morning. There’s now a very clear distinction between ego-moments and
no-ego-moments. What I’ve realized is that there is suffering in these
ego-moments, and I was wondering where this suffering might come from.
Does suffering appear because of the effort to try to create something
permanent and stable out of something that is inherently ephemeral and
empty?</p>
<h3 id="section-411"><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KYmlShAz_g&amp;t=1h5m19s">01:05:19</a></h3>
<p>In this way of seeing things as being ephemeral, everything changes,
change is constant, I do have a concern about rules and grasp of meaning
in terms of not being able to function and getting to a kind of a
nihilistic way of seeing. I understand that might be one thing holding
someone back from fully understanding or further wisdom. Maybe you can
say a few words to that.</p>

<p>Culadasa: There is always something for you to do. There is
intention. This is really what I think the Buddha was trying to
communicate to us referring to karma as intention and using the term
re-birth.</p>
<p>If you’re going to be engaged in the world, there has to be a Self.
You just don’t need to be attached to the form that that Self takes in
the moment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is reborn is the Self. And every time the Self is reborn, it’s
different, but what it is is based on what it was and what it did the
last time it arose. In its last birth.</p>
<p>So the idea of karma and reincarnation is a crude level of
understanding, understanding at the level of mythical and magical of
what is a very real process that’s happening hour by hour, moment by
moment.</p>

href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KYmlShAz_g&amp;t=1h18m57s">01:18:57</a></h4>
<p>They also call re-birth “cycles of existence”, and you get many of
them during a day. Maybe if you are unlucky and you are tortured by
someone, you are reborn in the hell realm; then maybe you need something
and you are reborn in the hungry ghost realm; and so on and so forth.
But if I understand it corrctly, in theory, when you get to the fourth
path, you stop being reborn? So do you king of live in the <a

<p>A friend of mine and myself are interested in an answer to a
question. There seem to be two different flavors of Awakening. The
self-realization of Advaita and the levels of Awakening described in
Buddhism. Although dissimilar when you examine the details, both types
of Awakening appear to be genuine and valid.</p>
<p>The Buddha disavowed the Advaita view, but a basic examination of
traditional <i>Advaita Vedānta</i> makes clear that the true Self they
are referring to⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman"><i>Brahman</i></a>⁠<span
class="em-dash">—</span>is not an entity or individualized aspect.</p>
<p>Given this, why is there such a difference in the realization of a
singular truth, and are these two views on Awakening really in
conflict?</p>

<p>Two weeks ago we were talking about the two sides of the Witness:
first recoginizing that there is no one doing anything, and the other
half being that there is no one observing or witnessing or watching. You
were pointing me to what the source of this observer might be. What
conceptual model might create an illusion that such an observer exists.
You pointed me to thinking in terms of everything being a process
including the I.</p>
<p>I think that it’s working in terms that it’s making my meditation
sessions more peaceful. My mind isn’t making so much effort trying to
analyze everything that is happening.</p>
<p>And that’s exactly my question. By not trying to analyze things, by
trying not to attach myself to the I, I feel like sometimes in
meditation I don’t really know what’s happening. And I wonder if this
state of not knowing is a good place to be in or if I should be trying
to do something else.</p>
<p>It’s not dullness, in case you wanted me to clarify.</p>

<p>I’m just wondering if there is any benefit to changing between
peripheral awareness and one-pointedness similar to what you describe in
Stage 6 when changing between the sensations at the nose and then to the
body. I came out of a cold recently and I’ve been feeling like I was
back at square one for a while. Some dullness and mind-wandering was
common and pretty annoying. But it occured to me to change between being
aware of everything to focusing on the sensations at my nose or in the
body. When I did this a number of times, I seemed to get a firm grip on
my practice again and mind-wandering and dullness did not last long
after that. I guess I’m asking if there is any benefit in doing this
beyond getting rid of dullness and mind-wandering.</p>

<p>I would again like to ask a question today with regards to the stages
and the strictness of when to practice in which stage. I was under the
impression that you said a few times that it was okay to practice in
several stages during one session. When I practice for 60+ minutes in a
day, I sometimes start out with light forgetting and see myself in Stage
3. Followed by a certain duration where I would judge myself to practice
according to Stage 4. Some intense thoughts or emotions sometimes also
draw me back to Stage 2, with certain periods of mind-wandering. I
assume that it is important to accept the settings as they are and not
be disappointed to be drawn back to the earlier stages. But is it
actually okay and even normal to practice in several stages during one
session? When reading TMI, I first got the impression that it was
important to complete a stage entirely before you start out practicing
in the next one. If that is true, what does it mean to complete a
stage?</p>
<h3 id="section-418"><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2aOw9Uhc-w&amp;t=1h12m23s">01:12:23</a></h3>
<p>I’ve experimented with cannabis in the past and I know of its
mind-numbing effects and that’s why that’s no longer something I pursue.
My experience back them was that you do get enhanced perception of
sounds and flavor, but there is a price for that you’ll have to pay
afterwards. Two days later you feel dullness throughout the day and
being less present.</p>
<p>I was wondering if you had an opinion on CBD which does not contain
THC?</p>

<p>After listening to almost all of you recording discourses, one thing
that I have sort of missed was much discussion of the tasks and
challenges for working in Stages 7, 8, 9 and 10. And I would be
interested in hearing you talk about those stages at some point.</p>
<h3 id="section-420"><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2aOw9Uhc-w&amp;t=1h24m46s">01:24:46</a></h3>
<p>I would say I’m around Stage 6–7 at the moment and one thing that
worries me a lot is that I don’t seem to be getting that very fine clear
virbratory sense of the breath. In the book you talk about how your
perception of the breath changes and it becomes sort of staccato as
other people described. You see the breath breaking down into
vibrations. What I get instead is that the breath stop being sort of a
physical thing and becomes something that is happening in my mind and
it’s much easier to focus on that mental aspect of the breath than the
physical aspect. And there is no dullness involved because I’m
completely with the breath, and my awareness is very bright and
expansive and clear, and I’m following every moment. I’m totally aware
that I’m breathing and in what moment. But there is just not a lot of
physical sensation connected to it. There is just a kind of a knowing in
the mind that that the breath is happening, and I’m able to follow that
quite easily. And I keep going, “But where’s all these very distinct
breath sensations that people say you’re supposed to start
experiencing?” On occasion, I did experience the breath becoming more
vibratory, but more and more it feels like there’s this shift from the
physical sensations to a mental component to the breath. It’s very
smooth and it’s quite easy for me to follow. So could you perhaps talk
about that?</p>

<p>Over the years I’ve heard people use the term “Dark Night” to
describe difficulty as the result of their practice. What has been
confusing is that I’ve seen it used to describe everything from a period
of relatively mild ennui through to more serious depression or anxiety
or to a profound sense of hopelessness or other existential crisis and
even to seeming psychotic symptoms.</p>
<p>I know the term “Dark Night” to originate in Christian mysticism, and
I’ve also heard you intimate that it has been misappropriated and has no
real place in the vocabulary of a meditator. Yet I’ve seen its increased
use and popularity in modern meditation movements, particularly
pragmatic dharma circles. Dr Willoughby Britton even runs support groups
and does research on the phenomenon.</p>
<p>Could you explain the “Dark Night” in its original context, and what,
if any, relevance it has to the experiences of Buddhist TMI meditators
or other contemplatives? Why does it occur? Is it something that can be
avoided? If it is not a real risk for meditators, are there other
adverse effects we should be aware of? Is there a more suitable term
that we could be using?</p>

<p>To be motivated to meditate, it would help to know if there are
after-death benefits of Awakening during life. Would you guess there
likely are or not? Such as a continued reduction of suffering in the

One is an adult and three are children. The adult teaches the children
meditation and eventually dies. One of the children remains unawakened,
one becomes a <i>sotāpanna</i>, one becomes an arhat. Then they all
die.</p>
<p>Do the deaths of the above described unawakened child,
<i>sotāpanna</i> and arhat precipitate future events any differently
than each other? Are there any different after-effects of their deaths,

<p>I was wondering if there’s any difference between surrendering as you
sometimes mention and letting all effort go to attain effortlessness as
you describe in Stage 7. I’m just curious because as I continue to
practice in Stage 6, I am attempting to make it a part of my
intention⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>to strive less for goals and
just do the practice for its own sake. Or at least keeping in mind the
underlying purpose⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>developing one-pointed

<p>I’ve been reading some books on polyvagal theory and polyvagal
therapy for resolving trauma. And one of the things they talk about is
that in the animal world after an animal goes into a freeze response,
when coming out of it, there’s often and agitation that releases some
sort of a suppressed energy or a part of the suppressed energy that led
to the immobilization.</p>
<p>A brief explanation of polyvagal theory is that the most primitive
response to an overwhelming threat is to play dead, which is
phylogenetically the oldest. Then comes the adrenal response which is
the fight or flight. And the latest in the phylogenetic evolution is the
ventral vagus which is tied in with the muscles of facial expression,
and so is related to communication between individuals.</p>
<p>And that trauma usually occurs before the age of 5 when your reaction
to emotional situations gets imprinted by either imitating or reacting
to those of your caregivers. And that oftentimes when we have these
strong outbursts of behavior, they are related to the uncovering of
these implicit reactions, that we don’t have a story about as to how
they arose, but they are just these remembered reactions.</p>
<p>So my question was, is it possible that these things of <i>pīti</i>,
the sensations that arise in meditation, might also be a form of the
same kind of agitation that releases this pent up energy? Because it
does have this agitating or bubbling nature to it.</p>
<p>And another question that’s sort of related to this is how would you
say <i>pīti</i> differs from the opening of a chakra? When it feels like
the heart or some other chakra opens?</p>

are forms of strong craving. For example, psychological addiciton to
smoking marijuana, maybe on the weekends. It is not something that is so
detrimental to my life that I need to seek professional help because
it’s not all the time. But still, I consider myself a serious
practitioner. I still have a regular meditation practice. It doesn’t
interfere with the regularity of it, but one part of my mind understands
that there are some negative effects on the quality of my mindfulness,
for example, on those days, and the quality of meditation. But still,
another part enjoys it so much that I still experience strong craving.
I’m wondering if I should approach it just like any other craving and

some other course of action should be taken. Maybe you have some

<p>I don’t have a question, just an update from the last time we talked,
if that’s okay.</p>
<p>For the background, I’ve been meditating using TMI for about 4 years,
and I was in a plateau somewhere in Stage 4, and I’ve been in that stage
for a very long time. That was the point of our discussion last
time.</p>
<p>Since then, one of the things that I found out was about the right
view. I think I didn’t have the right view about interactions and
people, so internally somehow I was demonizing everybody who was giving
me a negative opinion. And I think that since I started looking at all
of this as a process, I woudn’t really say that my meditation has
improved, but I think generally in life I’ve started to develop a much
more positive attitude and that is truly starting to reflect in my
meditations also.</p>
<p>I think that was something very crucial that I missed for all these
years. What do you think?</p>

<p>I have a question about conditioning. I’ve noticed some mental
conditioning in my meditations. Sometimes I withdraw myself from
sensation, and I can’t change this. I think it has been causing a
problem for me because it makes it hard to watch the sensations. What
can we do about subtle conditioning, mental behaviors.</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking lately about <i>sāti</i> and <i>samadhi</i> as
being two axes or dimensions of development. In TMI there is a certain
path that’s drawn in this two-dimensional space. And sometimes you refer
to what happens when you deviate from that path. I think that in my
experience I see more and more that the two are not as much correlated
as I thought they were from reading TMI.</p>

<p>I’ve been reading a book by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume">David Hume</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Enquiry_Concerning_Human_Understanding"><i>An
Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding</i></a>. (Culadasa: This is the
branch of philosophy known as epistemology.) In the book he says that
the law of causality is a view that arises because we’ve been seeing
since our birth that every phenomenon is accompanied by another
phenomenon right before it occurs, and therefore we conclude that the
first phenomenon causes the arising of the second phenomenon. However,
he argues, there isn’t any necessary connection between two phenomena.
In other words, we can’t know for sure that one phenomenon will cause
the arising of the same phenomenon in the future simply because it did
so in the past.</p>
<p>For example, we see that every time we see a ball hit another
motionless ball, the ball that is motionless starts to move. Therefore
we conclude that the impact of the first ball caused the motionless ball
to move. However, there isn’t any necessary connection between these two
events that indicate that this impact must give the result of the
movement of the motionless ball. We can easily conceive of another
outcome that follows the moment of impact. Like two balls becoming
motionless after impact.</p>
<p>This reasoning seems valid to me, and I started to think that, in
appearance, the concepts in Buddhism I mentioned above are based on this
law, therefore they do not bring a completely valid knowledge. For
instance, the law of dependent arising says that contact conditions
feeling. Is this statement formed because the arising of a feeling has
always come after contact in the past? I know these concepts are
profound and my understanding of the words feeling and contact is not
deep enough, and the concept is probably different than the
appearance.</p>

<p>I would like to talk about the Yogacharan idea of
storehouse-consciousness (<i>ālaya-vijñāna</i>). What you mentioned when
you described the Mind-System, one of the definitions I found is
“<i>Ālaya</i> is a sort of eternal substance or matter, creative and
containing all forms. When considered as a whole, it is non-existent or
contains nothing. When considered phenomenally, it fills the universe.”
It seems to be of the nature of materialism. It is the store or totality
of consciousness⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>both absolute and
relative.</p>
<p>Considering this, it could be possible that consciousness as a whole
might not be a local phenomenon, but rather a non-local phenomenon
containing all mind experiences. Even some scientists like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bohm">David Bohm</a> have
talked about the idea that what we think could be information stored
locally could be a non-local phenomenon. What do you think about this
idea?</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nPhm73Aaxw&amp;t=13m49s">00:13:49</a>
In the same vein, I would say that anything we experienced as humankind
requires creating a view. Anything we think, believe, learn etc. is
always a view⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>of a personal subjective
reality and happens any time from morning till evening. We can’t
function without creating a view.</p>
<p>In a way, our subjective being, what we experience is built entirely
out of a certain amount of this <i>ālaya</i>, and this is what makes us
think, “I am.” My view is that there is not any soul or real individual
entity, but I don’t believe in the Buddhist idea of <i>anattā</i>
(No-Self) either. I would say that there is a Self. We experience it
every day. It is made of mind experiences created and stored by
<i>ālaya</i>. We could be a construct of this <i>ālaya</i>.</p>

<p>What is death from your point of view? Do you have any thoughts on
what would happen next, right after the impact if you jumped off a cliff
causing a fatal injury?</p>
<p>In one sutta in <i>Majjhima Nikāya</i>, it is stated that one
reappears in accordance with his or her aspirations, and an arhat does
not reappear anywhere at all.</p>
<p>Do these statements imply that somehow this cycle of rebirth and the
world around us is an operation of mind. What is the relation of
<i>nibbāna</i> to this subject since it is also defined as being
released from the cycle of dying and reappearing along with the
cessation of greed, hatred and delusion?</p>

<p>I have a tendency to get easily stressed when dealing with difficult
situations. Often the feelings of stress go to my head and I get light
headaches with most of the pressure at my temples. There are times when
I do my sitting practice⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>even though I’m
not stressed and can feel the sensations of the breath quite easily
around my body⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>I feel pressure mostly on
my face, and at times at my temples. It seems to resemble the pressure I
feel when I’m stressed. Perhaps it’s because of how I dealt with
pressure or stress throughout my life and it spills into other
activities, whether I like it or not. It occurred to me a couple of days
ago during my sit that I tend to narrate what I should be experiencing
or doing. I don’t even know if that makes sense, but it’s like telling
yourself to feel the love, and you can feel very intense about it, but
you’re not really feeling the love, you are just feeling intense.
Instead of telling myself what to do, I should just do it and drop the
inner self-talk, if this makes any sense. I’m wondering if there is any
underlying issue that needs some resolving. Maybe this is just an
overall inability to relax.</p>

<p>Would you be able to clarify the difference between effortlessly
stable attention and effortless metacognitive awareness? In my sits, I
stablilize attention on the breath at the nose, then let go once joy
starts to arise, and if my attention remains stable, I then rest as
metacognitive awareness to observe the mind, allowing attention to move
freely. Sometimes dullness arises, which I assume means attention is no
longer effortlessly stable, but my subjective experience behind the
dullness is still very clear, alert, present and stable. Is it that my
metacognitive awareness is effortless, but not attention?</p>

<p>My inquiry is about Stage 7 purification process. A few months before
I started my meditation practice, I did a lot of daily mindfulness
practice. As a result, I started feeling a loosening of tension in my
chest. I had had that tension ever since I can remember. The tension was
so uncomfortable that I was almost unable to lie on my stomach. After I
started sitting meditation, the purifications sped up, and I quite
successfully went through what I believe I can describe as Stage 4
purifications, though purifications have been me to some extent since
Stage 1, and as I mentioned earlier, even before that. There was this
pattern to the purification process where I would feel as if there were
a thick hard jelly in the entire upper left part of my chest, some of
which would loosen up one day, and the next day I would feel energy
sensations in that particular place which were very soothing. The
sensations were so overwhelming that I stopped sitting meditation and
made the tension and following the energy sensations the focus of my
attention throughout the day. As time went by, the tension in my chest
became less and less uncomfortable, which tremendously raised the
quality of my life. I believe I am going through Stage 7 purifications
now, but the purification pattern has changed. It is now just the
tension loosening without the following energy sensations, which I find
very uncomfortable at times. What would you advise me to do in this
case? Also, how would you explain my uncommon, I believe, and strange
purification patterns. If it’s any help, I had full-blown DPD before the
purifications, along with a host of other mental health issues courtesy
of an extremely traumatic childhood. Thanks to you, I am now free of
almost all of them.</p>

<p>By confusion I mean state of mind that makes it impossible to focus

<p>Every time I check in, I don’t experience any thoughts. There’s

actively check in, I never find anything. How do I check in? Or what
does checking in feel like? Does it happen quickly, less than a second,

working at Stage 6, mostly. A few months back when I started Stage 5
practice and had been working on overcoming subtle dullness, I’ve
noticed an increase in mental energy. I’m noticing a lot of stuff I
didn’t notice before⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>both mental and
physical.</p>
<p>One very prominent phenomenon that is a distraction both on and off
the cushion is the feeling of energy in my forehead and between my
eyebrows. There is a feeling of agitation when I close my eyes making it
harder to close my eyes completely. This is especially an issue when I’m
going to sleep.</p>
<p>When trying to sleep, I’m trying to keep an awareness of the body,

<p>I have been practicing meditation on and off for about 5 years, and I
estimate that I’m currently at Stage 6, perhaps Stage 7. Truthfully, I’m
not sure. Simply put, subtle dullness no longer seems to plague me, and
my concentration on the breath is generally quite strong. These days, I
would say that my practice is focused on maintaining a wide scope of
attention by feeling the breath through my entire body. I also find that
I’m able to zoom out pretty easily and simply watch metacognitively how
the mind naturally directs attention and awareness as it sees fit.
Meahwhile, I still suffer from intermittent bouts of severe depression,
and I’d like to ask for your council on how to use meditation to deal
skillfully with it. My intuition tells me that I need to learn how to
simply allow the feeling of depression to reside in awareness without
allowing attention to dwell on it. And yet, in practice I find that when
the feeling of depression comes, I can’t help but pay attentin to it.
And the more I try not to pay attention to it, the more it seems that my
mind is determined to pay attention to it. It seems as if even when I’m
able to establish my attention on the breath, my mind refuses to let go
of attention to the depressed mood. The result is that attention is
alternating imperceptibly between the feeling of depression and the
breath. It’s quite frustrating to say the least, and leaves me wondering
if meditation might in fact be exacerbating the depression.</p>

<p>Sometimes there appears an awareness of a narrating mind in tandem
with a feeling which one might name conscience. Sometimes these two even
talk to each other. In the body, it seems this conscience is connected
to the stomach region where waves of feeling of fear and joy get in sync
with the tummy’s subtle relaxation. It’s more of a feeling rather than a
muscular contraction per se, so what is this conscience?</p>

<p>I’m having difficulties perceiving the environmental stimuli clearly.
I’m setting a strong intention to perceive details of those stimuli, and
eventually the breath sensations in the nose, also to find the balance
between activeness and passiveness in four-step transition.</p>
<p>When I intend to spend more time on environmental stimuli and push
myself to be actively in search of a sound or a bodily sensation to
examine its details with attention, the strong intention to perceive the
details of a particular stimulus usually doesn’t arise. Maybe it’s
partly due to the fact that usually environmental stimuli around me are
familiar and not stable, and not attractive.</p>

<p>I have recently read about the <i>vedanā</i> concept, and I’m

<p>Two questions about practices using breath sensations compared to
loving-kindness with regard to the stages, or at least up to Stage
7.</p>
<p>I understand that applying the advice is basically the same with
regards to stable attention. But I tend to get confused at some point.
For example, one can use breath sensations to see their impermanence and
develop Insight, or use them to go into <i>jhānas</i> and so on, but
with loving-kindness (or sometimes <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonglen">Tonglen</a> in my case),
besides bringing one’s attention back to the object, what happens when
one expands the scope of attention to include more and more people,
places, worlds etc. Is there something more than just an attitude
change? That would be my first question.</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKGfbBuemA&amp;t=50m15s">00:50:15</a>
I find when doing this practice that there is a point when I will
experience sensations throughout my body that are the same as in
whole-body breathing. A thought then pops up, “What do I do now?” Should
I drop everything and attempt <i>jhāna</i>? Do I just keep doing the
same thing being unsure where this is supposed to go besides just stable
attention? Do I even want these bodily sensations? Because they are
different from the feelings related to happiness, and somewhere along
the line I swapped them without giving it much thought.</p>

<p>I have a question regarding <i>metta</i>. I have a way of doing
metta: first sending the phrase, then imagining that the person is
smiling, and then maybe sending to them that feeling in my body. I think
that as a result of metacognitive introspective awareness it’s become
very easy to see how my attention is flickering between those three
things. Is that normal?</p>

<p>I started to think that loving-kindness is just another view. It’s
just a mental construct. You tend to see someone as repulsive or
perceive them as pleasant or desirable, but it’s just a mental
construct. It’s just a way of seeing things for a moment and then it
disappears.</p>

<p>It seems that knowledge is always in the form of mental fabrication.
Knowledge provided by science is known as a mental fabrication that
interprets a raw phenomenon. Knowlege provided by past experiences,
which is the basis of mindfulness that prevents us from doing certain
actions, or to be more specific, the knowledge or memory that comes from
a previous moment of consciousness is a mental fabrication. Even the

<p>I’m in the first few months of restarting meditation, and I feel
there is a tug of war between meditation flow and controlling for
external factors during sitting. For example, correct posture. I can
enter a flow where my breath becomes automatic and easy to follow, and
at the same time distractions arise but fade on their own due to their
obvious unimportance. But to enter this flow, I’m letting go of other
controls like reinforcing my posture, and consequently I find myself
absorbed in the flow with my breath, but starting to slump as I sit
because I’m not concentrating on correcting my posture, just on the
breath. What would be your recommendation at this point in the
meditation. Should I be reinforcing basic posture continuously at the
expense of interesting this incredibly content flow, or is it okay to
reinforce the enjoyment of each meditation session at the expense of
better posture?</p>

<p>I’m sorry that my question about <i>vedanā</i> two weeks ago was
confusing to you. Thanks anyway for taking your time to answer it. You
actually answered most of it.</p>
<p>Do you have any advice on how best to learn to realize whether a
particular mental object has a pleasant, unpleasant or neutral
<i>vedanā</i>? Can I trace the initial <i>vedanā</i> back from the
current state of mind? For example, an emotion or a thought.</p>
<p>Let’s say for example, I notice the arising of a pleasant
thought/emotion which itself arose as an association after something
else. Does it automatically mean that the initial mental object is
accompanied by a pleasant <i>vedanā</i>?</p>

<p>How does one distinguish between pain and discomfort that should be
dealt with vs the kind that comes from the mind’s ability to blow up
minor discomfort?</p>
<p>I can give an example. When doing walking meditation⁠<span
class="em-dash">—</span>like the two-part or three-part described in the
appendix⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>I recently started noticing
discomfort in my hip and groin. I’m not sure whether this is due to
something physical that should be attended to, or if it’s just something
that is blown up by my mind because attention goes there and makes it
stand out more in awareness.</p>
<p>I’ve noticed how stories rooted in worry quickly arise, and it’s very
insightful, but also quite distracting. I can’t help but worry if I’m
actually walking in a harmful way since walking this slow is not
automatic at all. I may be walking in a way that puts unhealthy pressure
on some joints.</p>
<p>I’ve tried re-reading through both Stage 3 and 4 on how to deal with
pain, and you mention that if it doesn’t persist after meditation that
shouldn’t be an issue. But it does persist sometimes. But here’s the
catch: I don’t know if this just because my attention has been drawn to
it so much that it’s standing out more than other things.</p>
<p>Should I consider walking meditation that doesn’t involve slow
walking?</p>

<p>I see you on a TV. I feel like TV, and especially algorithmically
supported unlimited entertainment like YouTube, Reddit and Netflix leads
to reduction of awareness and trains the mind to be distracted. With my
friends, they are often the focus of social gatherings either by
watching or talking about them, and they can be great sources of
information. How would you recommend one deals with these technologies
as to not hinder meditation progress.</p>

<p>After my morning sit, awareness slowly decreases throughout the day.
Would it be beneficial to plan small 10-minute sits throughout the day
to counteract that?</p>

<p>My meditation sessions tend to be between Stages 2–3. Which should
take precedence: greater detail on the breath, or maintaining
present-moment orientation?</p>
<p>It feels easier to avoid wandering if I try to maintain awareness.
For me at this point it looks like trying to zoom out and look at all
the sensations at once. But based on what I am reading in TMI, it sounds
like progress will involve greater attention to more and more subtle
details.</p>
<p>Should I be seeking greater detail even if it seems to result in
risking losing the stability of my attention?</p>

<p>What is boredom, and how does it relate to suffering and desire and
aversion? Sometimes I catch myself doing meditation just because there’s
nothing better to do. Like when walking or going to sleep. I’m wondering

suffering instead of alleviating it.</p>

<p>You know how sometimes you’re doing something painful like doing
stretches, and suddenly the mind realizes there’s no need to suffer.
That you can accept the pain, and that it’s easier that way. I’ve now
more than once caught myself scanning for suffering. My mind scans
consciousness to find suffering, and to extinguish it with its light.
This seems fine, but seems tiring. Can you comment?</p>

<p>I’ve listened to one of your talks in which you mention a faculty of
the mind that breaks down information into pieces, and labels the parts,
and imputes particular nature to those parts. But what exactly is this
information?</p>
<p>Is it the total sensory input we take in in a given moment of
consciousness, and does this information also include our interpretation
of these raw inputs? What is the whole and what is the part that is
obtained by this process of breaking down? I would be great if you could
provide an example to illustrate these terms.</p>
<p>Finally, <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmn_lz7tGFc&amp;t=1h9m42s">01:09:42</a>
why does the Insight into emptiness change drastically the way we see

see the world and act.</p>

<p>I’m a bit confused about the differences in experiences of moments of
awareness, rapidly alternating attention and awareness that takes place
simultaneously with attention. I have three different types of
experiences, and I’m not sure which one needs to be labeled as
awareness.</p>
<p>The first one is the experience of a sense of expandedness in
meditation like feeling less limited in terms of perceptual field which
seems to fit the description of awareness that takes place
simultaneously with attention in the first interlude.</p>
<p>Keywords: <span class="keyword">revision to the moments of
consciousness model</span></p>
<p>The other one is the experience of knowing something such as a
thought is there in a given moment of consciousness, but not knowing
much about its content. This example usually happens in daily life. For
example, while studying, I’m aware of the presence of some background
thinking activity, but don’t see its contents very clearly. But still,
this is experienced as a single moment of consciousness, not something
that takes place simultaneously while I’m paying attention to something
else as described in the first interlude. Is this a moment of awareness,
or a moment of attention in which the attention alternates so rapidly
that the thing it goes to is not perceived very clearly.</p>
<p>(The third one was skipped.)</p>

<p>I have no problem maintaining my introspective awareness, and I don’t
focus the attention so much that it’s to the exclusion of introspective
awareness. And I understand that the objective is for both of them to
grow in balance.</p>
<p>There are three ways in which I maintain that balance. One, I check
in; the other is the a-ha experience; and the third is just mainaining a
level of metacognitive awareness.</p>
<p>I tend to get into a situation where I’m constantly checking in,
which seems to result in attention using metacognitive awareness as the
meditation object. I’m wondering if I’m checking in too often, or if I
should favor the normal backdrop of metacognitive awareness where I
don’t focus the attention so much that I lose that.</p>

<p>You had a video about five ultimate insights on YouTube, and there
you talk about left-brain dominance. You said, “There is a
neurophysiological basis for Awakening. What happened to you is that you
came into this world, and became strongly inculturated so that many of
the right-brain functions became minimized due to inhibition from the
left hemisphere. The left hemisphere became dominant and this became
reinforced throughout your life, and you became trained to do, and
think, and feel in this way.”</p>
<p>I find this left brain–right brain distinction very helpful because
it is a convenient way to think about it in terms of rational thinking,
intuitive thinking, egoic thinking, non-self thinking,
time-bound–timeless. But rather than think in terms of right brain and
left brain, because we talk about the subjective consciousness, I like
to think about it in terms of right-mindedness and left-mindedness.</p>

<p>Meditation and mindfulness have helped me improve my behavior, and
increase my day-to-day well-being enormously. But I have a few questions
regarding handling purifications. The handling of emotional material as
described in the book during meditation and the mindful review of daily
events.</p>
<p>Question 1: Isn’t the undelying mechanism of these two essentially
the same? Bringing mindful awareness to what’s happening and learning to
let go because it only causes suffering to hold on to it.</p>
<p><a

Question 2: I have an unusually strong habit of comparing myself to
others, which can at times be compulstive. I have only had the chance to
address this issue during mindful review. It has not come up much during
meditation. No strong emotions, anyway. Just occasional thoughts and
memories. Should I just keep noticing in daily life when it’s triggered,
how the behavior makes me suffer, and over time I’ll naturally stop
doing it?</p>

<p>The main thrust of my question is to identify whether a period of
debilitating fatigue I’m experiencing can in some way be connected to my
meditation practice.</p>
<p>My hypothesis being the process of rewiring the brain requires
energy, and that this for some could be considerable, or perhaps it’s a
purificaiton. Also, I’m a proud possessor of a dyslexic brain. I would
be interested to hear if you know of any particuar challenges, or
indeed, advantages to this particular hardware configuration. Indeed, it
could be a factor in my fatigue when related to practice.</p>
<p>I work as a builder, and about a week before all this started, I had
a huge surge of energy lasting four days. I was fizzing, no stimulants
involved. What followed was three days with normal energy. The following
day, I turned up to start work and realized there’s no energy in the
tank. For the next two weeks, I did almost nothing. After this my energy
did partially pick up. Some weeks later I could feel that fizzy energy
returning that I experienced pre-crash. Unfortunately, there was no
substance behind it. Now two months down the line, quite happy in
myself, but still unable to work, I had various blood tests, scans and
x-rays, which so far have shown this organism to be in rather good
health.</p>
<p>Practice with TMI began 5 years ago, for at least an hour daily. I
also have benefited from walking meditation and regular <i>metta</i>,
self-retreats of 3 days, and one one-day retreat with a short period of
TM prior to this which I learned at 18. I’m now 56.</p>
<p>At Stage 4, I had little if anything in the way of
purifications⁠<span class="em-dash">—</span>other than body contortions
and some tears of gratitude.</p>

Fruits of practice include a dramatic reduction in depression which was
plaguing me most of my life; increased humility and compassion; reduced
craving; various insight experiences mainly involving
interconnectedness; enhanced appreciation of nature; vastly decreased
tendency to be resentful; take offense and hold grudges; some knowledge
of chronic fatigue.</p>
